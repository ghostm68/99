FADE IN:
EXT. FULL SHOT - AFTERNOON
What would be considered today a suburb, a small town.  But it is only six hundred or so years after  the ­death and resurrection of the Jewish prophet that is known by the name Jesus.  It is Ireland and Ireland is beautiful.  There is a gathering and although they are many, it seems uncrowded for the spaciousness is evident and marked by rolling hills and blue skies that stretch into infinity.  There are men, rugged and young.  There are women, lovely and learned.  There are children, restless and carefree.  Near the center of this celebration, sits a bearded man.  He is the chieftain, the ruler of this clan.  The king of this part of the emerald.  The monarch that defeated all rivals and took for his wife the only woman with eyes that did not reflect the moonlight in the evening when he looked into her eyes.  She is next to him.  Nan and Damon.  Beauty and brute strength.  His might seems more regal as we notice how perfectly she overshadows the other women.
CUT TO:
EXT. MEDIUM SHOT - CONTINUOUS
 
NAN 
My dear husband.  I do believe I feel our second child is astir within me.
DAMON
(placing a hand on her shoulder)
It will make you even more beautiful than the first one.
NAN
(placing a hand upon her belly)
May Jesus hear your prayer, my love.

DAMON
(removing his hand from her shoulder)
You forget that I am the ruler and this religion is no better than our ancient path, Befinde and Boanne will birth you right.

BACK TO SCENE
SIMPLE CELT MUSIC RISES AS DOES DAMON LIFTING HIS GOBLET AND SAYING A FEW INAUDIBLE WORDS WHICH CAUSES THE PEOPLE TO REJOICE. 

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GEREBERN'S SANCTUARY - EVENING
A priest in monk's cloth.  A silver cross accents his garments.  Its color a near match of his hair's shade.  He is speaking with a pretty young girl.  She is perhaps twelve or thirteen.
GEREBERN
My dear child.
DYMPHNA
Master, I am far from being a child.
GEREBERN
Dymphna, you will always be a yearling in my eyes.
DYMPHNA
Oh, master Gerebern, that is a pleasant thought, but parents have I already.
GEREBERN
They are flesh as I, remember to ever proclaim your true guardian in our Lord and Savior.
DYMPHNA
But you know that I do.  My heart is only at home under the freedom of the cross.
GEREBERN
That is as it should always be, my dear child.
DYMPHNA
(she pauses with a smile nearly changing the seriousness of her expression)
DYMPHNA (CONT'D)
I want us to pray for our Nan.  She is not the same after the baby was born cold and still.
GEREBERN
I know this well.  I have dedicated many hours with her in prayers and alone in mine orisons.  I know this well.  However, I fear that it is not our faith that has failed to bring her back into herself healed and beautiful as she was meant to be -
DYMPHNA
What could it be, master?
GEREBERN
It feels to me as if the pagan ways which Damon keeps have made for this suffering.  He scorns the belief that we hold sacred and I fear it will bring him sorrow beyond his imagination.
DYMPHNA
I cannot bear the thought.  I know that he believes not in Jesus, but he is good and he adores Nan.  I know it.  And sometimes when he looks at me, I am certain there is love in his eyes.


GEREBERN
Even good men, Dymphna, are brought low by the steely resolve of demons which they cannot see for the lack of light that covers them as they breathe the pagan air.
DYMPHNA
Will I ever be as wise as you?
GEREBERN
I am sure of it, but I will never be as beautiful as you.  Look at you, my dear Dymphna, you are becoming more lovely than our gracious lady Nan.
DYMPHNA
(she pauses again, this time the smile entirely covers the seriousness of her nature)
DYMPHNA (CONT'D)
Gerebern, you are handsome in a special way.
GEREBERN
If your grace is so inclined to agree.  Now let us tell our Lord the evening prayers before the moonlight is free of those low wandering clouds.

CUT TO:
INT. MORNING - NAN'S CHAMBERS - LATER
Medium sized room with a wooden window that is partly open to the start of day.  There is a crucifix similar to Gerebern's adorning the wall.  
Damon stands watch near Nan.  She is upon her bed.  Her countenance is pale.  The weakness is evident in her eyes.


DAMON
Even in sickness, you are still the fairest of these lands.
(pause)
It hurts me so to contemplate a life without our love.  More than any scar from battle or bygone days.
He walks a bit, slowly nearer to the window.
DAMON (CONT'D)
I see the new day starting, but what warmth can the sun bring to me if I cannot hold your hand.
He walks back, slowly nearer to Nan's bedside.
DAMON (CONT'D)
If only I could believe in your god, I would curse him with my uncorrupted honor for bringing you low during the season when we should be teaching our second child the ways of the world.
NAN
Speak not such words, think a moment upon my faith and your respect for me which should ever be entwined with your love.  He has wisdom beyond our brains and if He has decided -
DAMON
No spirit can decide the affairs of a King.
NAN
Jesus may be spirit, but there is more than that, there was flesh and his blood will give me life undying, even when if I leave this world.





DAMON
I have heard this talk too many days and it has poisoned you and it has poisoned our dearest Dymphna.  Imagine a beauty that is only rivaled by your own,  with a head - as empty as the caves of my vanquished enemies - that holds only reason for religion.
NAN
The girl is angelic.  Gerebern has taught her well.  Do not be upset, give thanks for what we had and have and hear my prayer that Jesus might hold you in His favor. I am grateful for Gereben.
DAMON
I should remove his head and see how many maggots have already moved in from the south of his body where obviously they did destroy his plow - by my name, I am sick of faggots - and let us have no more talk of religion.  I blame it for taking you, for tempting my Dymphna, for taking my unborn - oh that we had had the ceremony as we did in the old days, tell, me woman, when was a mother made to suffer in such way in those days and when was a chieftain ever said to have lost a child.  In the womb!  In the womb, a thing nearly made.  No - you said, no.  No sacrifice, no offering, nothing.  Prayer, just prayer.  The Druids would all lay down dead to hear such things.





NAN
Let us not argue over things we cannot change now, my love.  Nothing, no one is at fault.  I am happy to have had such as you at my side and to know that you will protect our Dymphna and find a stronger bride to have all the children you could desire.
 
DAMON
If your god is there, he is at fault though he give you life after this.  And my cherished passion, I am at fault for how could I betray my own good sense and listen to your request that we make no ceremony for our unborn.  I swear it is your beauty that distracts my strength and here we are and all I will have left is Dymphna.
NAN
Come nearer to your wife, dear husband and hold me again without words that I may pass on with the memory of your love inside me.
DAMON
As it was since I first fell under your spell, your wish is mine own desire.
Damon saunters over to the window one last time, pushing it closed.  He turns and starts to undo his garments, returning to her side and joining her in bed.
They make love, quietly, quickly...
NAN
My dear love, oh that Jesus would take me now.



DAMON
All I will have left is Dymphna - woman do not leave - it will be - it will be nothing without you - All I will have left is Dymphna.  Oh, my Dymphna.


CUT TO:
EXT. AFTERNOON - FIELD OF LILIES NEAR A POND - LATER
A young man is juggling three small skulls, they are polished and painted in three different colors.  A young lady sits nearby.  She is nearly identical to him, save for her hair and the obvious curves of her body.  The young man is the entertainer for the Chieftain and those near to him.  Nolan and Shelag, both in their twenties.
Approaching them is Dymphna.
NOLAN
I hear the steps of one perhaps tired from all the poetry of those prayers.
SHELAG
Do not push her away with unkind words, Nolan.  What type of a court jester would do such a thing to one he serves?
NOLAN
I serve her not, for I serve her father.  I say it as a friend.
SHELAG
What type of friend would find joy in mockery?






NOLAN
A friend that also does pray the same poetry and knows how eyes might become weary for the natural prose of casual life.
SHELAG
Sense.  It makes it, but be careful for I have much admiration invested with the fair princess and if you go too far I won't make any more little skulls for tricks.
NOLAN
A threat?
SHELAG
A truth.
NOLAN
A throaty truth with teeth.
SHELAG
Save the wit for Damon and the like or for after our love is detailed in the sleeping room of our kiss.
NOLAN
And it bites.
Nolan stops juggling, tossing each skull expertly to Shelag by wrapping his left arm behind himself and making them disappear into her hands which vanish them into a large leather satchel sitting in dark contrast to the bright afternoon.
DYMPHNA
My dearest friends.
SHELAG
Oh fair one, we may be dogs, but our ears are not so keen, speak when you are nearer or shout that we may seduce the meaning.



NOLAN
Your constant judgments have left you deaf.  It was a simple greeting and speak of yourself when using the noun of common canine to adjective.
SHELAG
For all you know, you may be a dog.
NOLAN
I may bark and wag some kind of tail, but it is all show, you know, I am all cat.  Lion on the better days, in fact.
SHELAG
Shall I call you my pussy?
NOLAN
Only if you are well positioned to stroke my fur.
DYMPHNA
I say, my dearest friends.
SHELAG
None of this you heard, dear one.
DYMPHNA
None at all, I giggle at the beauty that graces us this goodly day.
NOLAN
Such goodness will forgive the crude words that we have formed if heard and if unheard such goodness will find patience while we cook up other phrases to free the joyous laughter from yes our dearest friend.
 



SHELAG
Indeed, our dearest friend.
NOLAN
How may we make you smile this fine day, lovely Dymphna?
SHELAG
Indeed, how may we take you sailing into the freedom of joy, gracious Dymphna?
DYMPHNA
Nothing would please me more than to simply stay here awhile among these flowers, by this lake, with you my good and faithful friends.
NOLAN
I think she means to make me perform with cards.
SHELAG
(reaching into the satchel)
SHELAG (CONT'D)
It would seem the case since she said she would be pleased by staying here a while and only a performance with cards would take that long for all his other tricks are of cheap stock and as such they take no time to try.
(flings a deck of cards at Nolan)










NOLAN
What slander, if there were not truth in it I might be tempted to slay her.
 
(pretends to try and catch the cards, but allows them to tumble down seconds away from where he stands)
NOLAN (CONT'D)
I am truly rattled now, perhaps all skill is gone from my reservoir.
SHELAG
I was thinking the same thing, last time we kissed.
NOLAN
For that, I will not kiss you ever again while the sun is green.
SHELAG
How about while the moon is black?
NOLAN
I am tempted to agree.
SHELAG
If only you were tempted to learn some new tricks.
NOLAN
My nose is running and if I should sniff another dog joke -



SHELAG
Wait, let me go chase after it, Damon would have you in chains if a nose were running about his land.
NOLAN
Damon already has me in chains and added insult to injury by pairing me with you.
SHELAG
I might be settled but I am far from paired, for where is our child.
NOLAN
You forget that we have a child right here.
SHELAG
Our dearest friend.
DYMPHNA
Really, you don't have to go through the display with words or the cards, really, I am pleased to simply be here at your side, upon this garden.  And Nolan, I am not a child even if I am ever at your funny nest.
NOLAN
I can see by the blossom of your chest that you are not a child, but to us - if we are still us?
SHELAG
We are, pending an apology or two.
NOLAN
To us, you are the better part of ourselves.  You are as we would hope our child to be.  Take no injury from my words.



SHELAG
It is that season when we girls want not to be girls but something greater.  Fear not the thoughtless opinion, Dymphna, some will say "child" to thee even after the grave has risen to cover what was life.  And, indeed, you are as we would hope our own offspring would be - I hope you will know a time when to hear the word child will remind you of the easiest days of your life and from those future wrinkles you will grin and perhaps also remember us.
DYMPHNA
I will remember and I will try to keep in mind the wisdom of your words, my Nolan and Shelag.  You have taught me near as much as Gerebern with your wit and magic.

CUT TO:
INT. GEREBERN'S SANCTUARY - LATER
 
Damon
I fear that tonight will be her last. 
Gerebern
The force of prayer is at work, Damon, and a miracle is nothing for Jesus if He is moved to grant us our desire.
Damon
You call me by my name as if there were equality between us, preacher.




Gerebern
I apologize, my king, I meant not to disrespect your position as I meant not to carry myself beyond mine own rank.

DAMON
You speak of desire and yet you pretend to have none. Tell me, holy man, what desire led me to you tonight?

GEREBERN
My dear king, I cannot read your heart’s mind. I believe that perhaps you wish the comfort of our Lord’s grace in this hour of turmoil. 

DaMON
See hear, preacher, I desire not your superstition for I’ve mine own belief.

Gerebern
In that case, I cannot imagine what has brought you into my door.

Damon
It is not your door, it is my door and you’d do well for yourself to remember that.

Gerebern
I do apologize indeed once more.





Damon
No need to excuse your arrogance. Now, be silent and I will explain the reason for my visit.
Damon (conT’D)
I came here tonight, as my most precious beloved and your queen struggles for her life, to end your pathetic existence and send you first into the underworld where  Aengus might hang you himself from the barren tree of celibacy for refusing to plant here in this green garden your seed.
Gerebern
You mean not these unkind words, it is your sorrow that speaks through your mouth with violence.
Damon
Save your foul sermon for the stupid. We both know that you have not met with swords and thus you cannot know how sweet it is to slay. I would kill you now just to have that victorious feeling in my hand once more.

Gerebern
Oh, my Lord, let not my king make me a dead man before I have said one last prayer.






DAMON
Ha, here is my steel and here is my saber, say your words to the air you fill with that idiotic doctrine which has tried to position itself above the laws and knowledge of our ancestors.
Gerebern
Help, someone help me, the king has gone mad, the king has gone mad! 
Damon
You are coward and though I have not vanquished you, you are as good as dead to my eyes.  
Gerebern

I am bleeding, I am bleeding, oh let not my darling Dymphna encounter me in this state.

Damon
No one will see you, my PYTHIUS is at the entrance and this I swear, Gerebern, I will not allow you near the Princess after the Queen has taken her place in the heavens.  Your bed has most likely blossomed lovely dreams with my Dymphna and if I were you – ha, there is an insufferable idea - if I were you I  would do well to walk far away from the kingdom of this King. 















CUT TO:
INT. MIDNIGHT - NAN'S CHAMBERS - LATER

Nan
Dearest Dymphna, dry the tears from your eyes with the faith that nears you to all that is good and holy in this passing world.
Dymphna
Mother, I cannot help but cry. Your example has led my life and I know my faith will be divided of its greater portion when you are gone. 

Nan
Think, my child. There are many that love you and will concern their thoughts for your safety. Do not let sorrow destroy that affection. Do not let my death make a dream of your greatness. 

Dymphna
I have not importance, not even wisdom, mother. I tell you, when I lay upon my bed and turn my eyes to slumber there is often a sound that will not let me breathe easy.
Nan
A sound?
Dymphna
The sound, yes, the purr and rattle of a feeling.





Nan
A sentiment that your own self holds or an emotion from another?
Dymphna
I cannot say, but it seems to speak of a voyage. A journey into a far away land.
Nan
I remember when I was a girl. I dreamed always of travels. To visit far away lands.
Dymphna
Do not rise, mother, you need to rest. 
Nan
No. I want to whisper these words into your ear and embrace you at least one last time.
Dymphna
What reason held you here?
Nan
My child, in those days a woman could not simply pick and choose. I was picked instead I was chosen by the King your father to be his uxor, to be Queen.  
NAN (CONT’D)
The only choice I’ve ever held truly as mine was to bow my head low before the love of the Cross. 
Dymphna
I am afraid that my eyes will always water at the remembrance of your devotion.




Nan
Forget not that you are the Princess and forget not that death cannot bury faith. Believe in our savior as I and Gerebern have always lectured into your lovely heart.  Follow not the pagan ways of King Damon.
Dymphna
I believe I hear him charge upon the grounds.
Nan
Help me back upon my pillow, dear child and let us pray before his arrival.

CUT TO:
EXT. MIDNIGHT -FIELD OF LILIES NEAR A POND- CONTINUOUS
GEREBERN, Wounded, makes haste away from the lands of DAMON.
He is carrying a leather satchel and murmuring words and phrases which alternate between curses and prayers. 

CUT TO:
INT. MIDNIGHT - NOLAN AND SHELAG’S HUT – CONTINUOUS
NOLAN is removing his garments while trying to convince SHELAG to make love to him before going to sleep.

  SHELAG
Have I missed something between our earlier conversation and this talking?




NOLAN
How are we ever going to grow into three when the two of us do not attempt to make love?

Shelag
Oh, Nolan. How dare you dance into such words not to mention ignore my question.

Nolan
I have not ignored your query, I have simply tried to make better sense of our situation and therefore the question might need no response save for the physical words of fornication.

Shelag
I do remember with the sharpest clarity your vow not to kiss me while the sun was green or was I daydreaming?

NOLAN
Shelag, the sun is at rest and the heavens are as dark as jealousy.

SHELAG
Would you say then that the moon is black?

NOLAN
It may well be and -






SHELAG
And so I see you are not a man of your word.

Nolan
I often entertain with tongue and wit and it’s no dishonor to delve into the devil’s brush to canvas some picture for a laugh. 

SHELAG
Is your love for me a laughing business?

Nolan
No my Shelag and it’s not a fair question to put to your Nolan for I have been nothing but true to you in time if not always in speaking.

Shelag
And now you wish to explore my Rhine and my Rhone with your gondola.

Nolan
If you insist on making the navigation a sail, let me gather the anchor and hook it under the hammock. 

Shelag
Perhaps we might not swim at all for you well know I would hate to drown.  Perhaps, I should turn your plea into patronage and sell you that portion which you are trying to pursue.



Nolan
Nay, a husband cannot offer a reward to his own wife for tenderness.
Shelag
For tender I would attend you twice.
NOLAN
Let us say, I gave you punt. Would that suffice?
SHELAG
For a punt I would be hard pressed to hunt much.
NOLAN
For a punt and a pint?
SHELAG
Hmm. For that I might rummage, some.
NOLAN
Then you will have a punt and a pint, now let us tickle each other with passion. Begin your rummaging.
SHELAg
Whoa.  When shall this tender be rendered true?
NOLAN
Soon. All too soon.
SHELAG
Then soon you will have that rummaging passion.
NOLAN
What about at present?




SHELAG
At present, you have the memory of our wedding, of our vows, and just last week I did hold your hand for a while after we kissed.
NOLAN
We kissed not last week at all.
SHELAG
Ah yes you were fast asleep, well, here at present receive this peck from my feeding gap before your mind escapes into the land of dreams.
NOLAN
Shelag, this can’t go on. I am a man and have the needs of a man.
SHELAG
Nolan, I know you too well, you are but a witty boy and your impatience proves this beyond doubt.
NOLAN
I cannot make sense of what is senseless. I will stay in my hovel by the river. Come not to my side with sly kissing as I rest.  
Shelag
I will make a man of you yet, Nolan. 
NOLAN
Aye, a desperate man!











CUT TO:
EXT. MIDNIGHT - DAMON AND PYTHIUS – CONTINUOUS

DAMON
Look there, my trusted Pythius, the sermonizer has fled across the field. 
PYTHIUS
Did your steel slash for death, I heard the man give voice for assistance.
Damon
PYTHIUS, we are men. Do not refer to an insect as a man. He is a bug and I should have made his insides spill out under the pressure of my toes.
PYTHIUS
My good King and great commander, I will not give the name of man to his kind evermore. And, if it pleases you, allow me to walk across the field and remove that backswimmer from the waters of your kingdom.
DAMON
You serve me well my good PYTHIUS, but I did provoke enough of his blood from its course for now and perhaps when the time comes I will call upon you to render him forever gone but I cannot destroy the preacher entirely while your Queen my wife is breathing the quick air of life.







PYTHIUS
It is not my place to say, but I do hope our fair and gentle Queen Nan should endure for a sure and extended spell.
DAMON
PYTHIUS, your words sound poetic, have you been burning the words off the old runic books with those bloody eyes?
PYTHIUS
My good King and Great Commander, it has been a while since we went to war or faced the invading battle of pillage, our enemies are all under the greatest fear even from our cattle and what can cows do?
PYTHIUS (CONT’D)
Indeed, it is a matter for us to rejoice  in and our descendants to find pride from. You are wise or you have gained the ability to glint into the glen of secret thoughts. I have for lack of love and lack of campaigns given my free hour to the those texts.
DAMON
Are not the days of soldierly instruction, marching, and the nights of keeping guard enough to fill your hands. 

PYTHIUS
I am the active sort of fellow and I like a lot of activity as in the bygone days when we first learned to capture and to kill. For others, I am certain all the formations and the watch are enough to make them foolish with desire for sleep.


DAMON
My good soldier, that is good to know and yet I do recall you also spoke of love and having none. I will myself find a fair maiden for you to espouse and you will name your children after the true gods of this our bright emerald.

PYTHIUS
If it so please you my good king and great commander. 

DAMON
I sense a tone of worry along with your appreciation.

PYTHIUS
There is – I – well, I -

DAMON
Speak the thought as well you can, I have not all night to ear and tongue.

PYTHIUS
I do engage – when coin and cock have purse and pulse – with the whores.

DAMON
With the whores, you say?

PYTHIUS
I meant not to offend with – with -






DAMON
No no I wanted to make sure you said not horse. Fret not kinsman, for indeed we are related by the school of scars. I too have indulged with a trull when afar where only the trollop was available. I will find you a fair maiden who will mind not if you fall into the arms of some wench. 

PYTHIUS
I dare not shout for we are near your entrance, but I do say with a loud heart by Lug, there can be no better king in all the lusty world.
DAMON
Stand a while, good PYTHIUS and see that the bug does not crawl from there to here to try to avenge himself or to make the Queen suffer any more from the pansy infection of his talk.

PYTHIUS
Is your order to slay, should he approach.

DAMON
Slaying’s for soldiers, no need to employ your good blade, my trusted PYTHIUS, simply step on the shirtlifter as you would stomp the starving wood ant which tries to feed on your fare. Your foot and the pain I have already inflicted should serve enough to make the insect expire.

PYTHIUS
My good king and great commander, I will stand through the night and I will stand through the day if needed. 
Consider Name for PYTHIUS, pythius…

CUT TO:

EXT –  FIELD OF LILIES PAST THE POND – CONTINUOUS 

GEREBERN paces back and forth as if unable to decide on what to do or where to go. 
The rustling sound of someone nearing sends him into words.
GEREBERN
Sweet heavens, protect me, who’s there?
NOLAN (o.S.)
Fear not, stranger. It is only a married man with a wife as mean and unbearable as a mule that will not serve for burden.
GEREBERN
Nolan, I am no stranger to you. Although my voice suffers the sadness and my back is bent low from the rage of blows, it is still Gerebern.
NOLAN
I am rather unhappy to hear of your troubles, but being a man of the cloth you cannot imagine mine. How strange the times are when one seeks only isolation or an easy lass to linger with yet encounters an injured clergy.
GEREBERN
Forgive me for me for breathing, would it please you to finish me off? Look here, jester, the blood still flows from his cuts.
NOLAN
Perfect. Now I am nothing but a midnight nurse. Here, here, good Gerebern, let us sit and see how we may mend your flesh and perhaps if you survive you’ll be kind enough to give my mule a speech so that I may unburden my load of lust as a man must and should with his wife.
GEREBERN
Agreed, there under the elm.
NOLAN
I have not seen blood since the last battles. Our King the majestic Damon was magical in strategy and mighty in strength. Do you recall when they -
GEREBERN
I recall the battles, Jester, but mind you that not all of us wish to seduce flattery for the monarch. It was the king himself who hurt me.
NOLAN
So you have you a bone to pick with the king as I have a boner that pines for Shelag’s kettle hole?
GEREBERN
You forget that I serve the sacred order of Jesus. 
NOLAN
I forget not and I perhaps more than your followers respect your vows, save for Dymphna and her regal mother, to these new notions, yet it is late and my tongue leans straight into honesty. Say now why have you taken offense with Damon.



GEREBERN
He wants me to perish, he wants me gone. He would have cut deeper if it were not that our saintly Queen is still among us.
NOLAN
Look, the cuts are now in a band and given that you create a bit of rest for yourself, they will heal. 
GEREBERN
I thank you, Nolan. If it weren’t for you -
NOLAN
If it weren’t for me you would perhaps have fled to a dismal death and left the lovely Dymphna who so regards you as another father to fend alone with the very faith you have helped to fashion within her heart.
GEREBERN
I really -
NOLAN
You really should rest and when you are feeling strong and hungry at the dawn you will deliver yourself to my Shelag and tell her how my hands trembled when they helped to heal these black and red bruises and how all I spoke of was how much I did long to be at her side.
GEREBERN
Oh Jester, you have a quick mouth and a wicked brain.





NOLAN
I have actually slowed since some in the crowd complained that I did speak too quick and indeed they argued mumbled yet my only wickedness has ever been this love for Shelag, for Shelag I would to hell with the world. 
GEREBERN
Tempt not fate, already the night has brought me violence and fear.
NOLAN
Is that an indication that some of our ways are still beside your new ways of worship.

GEREBERN
No. that is simply a stolen thought from the holy book. 
It is not that which enters the mouth -

NOLAN
The conjecture is very similar to some composition which was sometimes told me in the earlier years of my life when I knew not want of woman and all was without complication.
GEREBERN
Wise thoughts have a way of passing through the ages.






NOLAN
What wisdom could now be greater than leaving you here to linger at repose while I retire to my little room in the plain without hammock or her and see what dreams will deliver themselves into the decorations of my as you have wrongly judged wicked brain.
GEREBERN
Take not insult from my injured state, we are friends and friends we shall remain as far as ships may the fortune of waters span which is to say into the farthermost distance. May the grace of faith make it so and as it will please you I will entreat at the dawn your lovely and kind Shelag to be gentle and giving to your -
NOLAN
Yeah, to my command and conduction!
GEREBERN
Sometimes, you say so much, too much.
NOLAN
Perhaps, but I am glad we have met as this for I was certain somehow that you were taller.









GEREBERN
Taller?
NOLAN
Yes. In the rhetorical sense. I like it that we are both simple at heart and have found a common ground to further our ties.

Cut to:
Int – morning – nan’s chambers – 
NAN has passed away and her body rests upon the bed.
DYMPHNA and DAMON are in the room grieving for the gone wife and mother. 
DAMON
Do not linger over our beloved Nan with your tears, my child.
DYMPHNA
Father, the sadness overwhelms me so that I cannot breathe as I should.
DAMON
Here, my child, let us embrace and share our sorrow.
DYMPHNA
I cannot hold you, I have only the strength to weep and pray that mother has already found heaven in her afterlife.







DAMON
Dymphna, I meant not that you should hold me but rather that I should comfort your weary heart, fear not for Nan’s afterlife for a queen is monarch in the celestial spaces just as here on our earthly grounds.
DAMON (CONT’D)
It will be the same for you, if I marry not then you shall be empress of my empire.

DYMPHNA
I do not – I wish only to find all the goodness that my confused heart hides. I do not – I do not want to be the queen. Look upon her now as she sleeps into the dream of eternity. None can replace Nan. 
DAMON
That is true, my tender young one, yet you are also irreplaceable. 
Dymphna
Look upon me truly. I am clumsy and small  and still so unlearned even with Gerebern’s precepts. 
DAMON
I see only that you are becoming a woman and I say I to you on this sad day that I will hear no more of that charlatan and neither will you have to suffer his foolishness.






Dymphna
Oh, father, if I am to become a woman as mother did intend and I do desire then I must continue with my learning and embrace our faith with stronger arms. Promise me you’ll preserve my mother’s trust and not send the good Gerebern away.

DAMON
My dearest Dymphna, let us not face each other with fences at this hour. Please, take my hand and let me hold you nearer to my own heart 
DAMON (CONT’D) 
Which has been made heavy by this most hurtful death. 

DYMPHNA
It is a true consolation to embrace when sadness surrounds the soul.

DAMON
With this kiss, I say to you that today no longer are you an infant and with this kiss, I say to you that today you are matured by the passing of your mother, and with this kiss, I say to you my darling Dymphna that no longer is any woman above you in this our kingdom. 

DYMPHNA
I feel a flutter in my belly which does not mix well with my heartbreak – my intention is to be pious – kiss me not anymore. 





DAMON
Indeed. Let us mourn as we should and lionize your matureness upon some kinder moment. 

DYMPHNA
That would be well and good.

DAMON
Wait. Be not so swift to leave my arms. Hold your king and father for a minute more.
Dymphna
I will for I trust it will please her spirit and perhaps tempt a better understanding between 
DYMPHNA (CONT’D)
Us so that maybe my dear father will be reconciled with the faith he is still uncertain about and yet was the moving force in her life and is the very magic which makes me feel nearer to who I should be.

DAMON
The mind may ponder many possibilities yet ever be mindful that we are cast by providence and fastened by fate  upon this fiery earth of blood and water. My sacrifices and victories have paid your way and paved a road smooth as a daydream. You may garden or you may garment, you may practice arts or you may pray. All as it may please your powers, but I need neither reconciliation nor recourse to superstition having known the power of our own true cult and holding witness to the cowardly ways of this new religion. 


DYMPHNA
Let not such words your mouth speak my father for they do blaspheme and moreover hurt my ears as sharply as any pain.

DAMON
Very well then, let me make the proper preparations and let us go and greet this day with reverence for her that loved us more than herself. Perhaps, tonight you will be willing to explain your faith and reasoning, to elaborate on this martyr which moves your mind to allegiance and in so doing perhaps then I might join along and even build you a proper tabernacle for us to taste together the joy my lost Queen and yourself have tried to make explicit to my understanding.

DYMPHNA
I will come to your dwelling before the sleeping hour has arrived that we may hold this conversation and hopefully this conversion. I should tell Gerebern for he would be most pleased.

DAMON
Do not say anything to anyone until we have in private met and my perturbed mind is far from the present sorrows and made perfect by the religious information only you will proffer to me in secret for I need not have my pride suffer with uncertain declarations until my decision is set.

Dymphna
It shall be our secret until you feel certain of a change and I am certain you will.




Cut to:
Int – morning – SHELAG’S PLACE– CONTINUOUS
GEREBERN has arrived, in keeping his promise to Nolan, to hold a conversation with SHELAG and to remove the hunger which -along with the violence and upheaval- has made him edgy.

SHELAG
Pardon me, Priest, for taking so long.
GEREBERN
The wait was not long, Shelag. Actually, I could have stayed under the sun a while longer.
SHELAG
You are bandaged in a hasty and horrid manner. 
GEREBERN
There was only haste in the wound but none in the healing. I have your good man to thank for helping me through the night.
SHELAG
Nolan, you mean.
GEREBERN
Yes, your husband. 
SHELAG
The child, you mean, I am training to be my man.
GEREBERN
Be that is it might, I’ve had not nourishment all the long hours of the darkness into this new dawn.



SHELAG
Well, lean into the chair and I will bring you some breakfast and wine?
GEREBERN
Wine. Perhaps only a chalice.
SHELAG
Recount to me this encounter with the unusually aggressive Nolan last night while I serve your early supper.
GEREBERN
He was far from anger, in fact he was all angel. I must say it would be a sin for such a lovely pair to linger long inside the confines of argument.
SHELAG
There is no sparring, he simply has to wait upon my kisses or bring me a punt and a pint as we have agreed.

GEREBERN
A punt and a pint?

SHELAG
Indeed. Here, here is the chalice. Give the bread another moment. 

GEREBERN
I know not what dealings you two have agreed to within your marriage contract, but lend me a listen with your patience. The intoxicant is untamed.



SHELAG
It is the strongest we have, you’ll not remember your bandages after a sip or two. Say what you must while I fetch the food.

GEREBERN
The matter is a simple one truly. 

SHELAG
Here is your nourishment, with anticipation I would have meat to strengthen your constitution.
GEREBERN
Think not of anything better but this bread, fruit, and wine for I would have chosen it before any other grub.
SHELAG
Resolve my curiosity then if the matter is a simple one truly as you say why not state it without hesitation.
GEREBERN
Although it is in the aspect of simplicity, I fear it is a matter for much delicacy.
SHELAG

I can see by your blush that the sly fox of Nolan’s hunt escaped into the shadows of your pity.

GEREBERN
I know not what you mean, I intend only to entreat your compassion so that his heart is made to feel the passion he desires.


SHELAG
Men desire many things in this devious world, Gerebern.
Gerebern
There is truth in your words, Shelag, yet as a wife you must respect your husband and if not then at least you must pay heed to your vows and consummate your union.
SHELAG
Perhaps, you came here to have a practice session in his stead?
GEREBERN
Child, I am a man with a covenant.
SHELAG
Sir, you are a man.
GErebeRN
I am aware, but I am not a man as you would like to imply.
SHELAG
Are you implying that your third leg serves only the limp service of making salty waters?
GEREBERN
I realize your wits serve to entertain yet I am not amused by these implications and especially that question.
SHELAG
I am making a point and your pointed response tells me there is some poetry in your pen still.
GEREBERN
Shelag, just please consider giving Nolan some affection.




SHELAG
It has been taken under consideration, now should we have our first rehearsal so that you may report back to Nolan how well I will perform for him?
GEREBERN
Let us not engage further in this line of talk.
SHELAG
Quite right, let us to action.
NOLAN
You are seducing my Shelag after I shaved the hair of pain from your bloody beard!
GEREBERN
It is not what you think, my dear friend.
NOLAN
What other thought should I find when she is-
SHELAG
I am as you wanted, my husband. Of course for two there should be more than a punt and a pint. 
GEREBERN
Sweet Jesus, how have you led your poor servant to such distress.
SHELAG
There is no distress now undress along with me so that we may start our practicing as Nolan has requested.






Nolan
What a day is this that our great Queen Nan has gone to the other world and now I must slay her confessor for placing the cruelest horn upon my head behind my back after I have – Oh I should have let you perish under the oak’s wood.
Gerebern
You have lost your mind. Tell him, Shelag, Tell him we have only shared words and that you did but jest.
SHELAG
Our Queen has died and you worry over a beating from a jester, Gerebern you are a worm. 
Nolan
Prepare to travel unto the far away western lands where no man returns from!
SHELAG
I do believe we will have another head for the shrunken collection.



Cut to:
EX – morning – BURIAL GROUND–
DAMON stands alone overlooking the final resting place of Queen NAN. 
PYTHIUS the PYTHIUS stands in the distance. 
The day is bright under the hot sunlight.




DAMON
Dear Queen and beloved wife. I place here your necklace and your treasured mirror. May these belongings remind you of me in the other world. Surely, now you have seen the error of placing your faith in superstition and that damned Gerebern. Hear me oh greatest Dagda, there flies my own heart with that woman. Forgive her for being weak of mind, for following the sign of the Christian’s Cross. Dagda she is a Queen but even a queen is only a woman at the core and womanhood was never good at understanding or at being understood. I have sent many a spirit through war and battle to serve in your great kingdom as you would have them slave or simple and have asked nothing yet –  yet now I do implore you holy overlord to see her not as flawed or frail from religion or sex but as you would see my own self in truth and time. Hear me oh grand Dagda, there cries my own spirit at her departure from my world. 













Cut to:
Int – morning – SHELAG’S PLACE– CONTINUOUS

SHELAG
You could have not hurt him as much as he was already well bruised.
NOLAN
You could save your tongue’s lecture and kiss me now that I am aroused from having seen once more the peach pink exclamation points of your excellent chest  and my breath is heavy from the hurt I have rightfully given Gerebern’s head.

SHELAG
You might be excited and yet you are mostly mistaken, my still young husband. For you shall see that these nipples you proclaim as peach pink are really a salmon carnation for they shall wisdom our infants – that is – if you happen to someday mature truly and I must confess that Gerebern’s head deserved not that hurt.
NOLAN
One day it is maturity and another it is a punt and a pint and what do you mean that the priest did not merit the aching pain I did with pleasure provide?




SHELAG
It was my aim to entertain my day with your jealousy and I knew in my heart that you would not slay him for you a not the homicidal sort. 
NOLAN
Yet Gerebern is not a bad man, now how shall I look into his eyes.
SHELAG
Surely you will see his glance again and when you do my eager husband, remember to not urge his mouth to music for your serenade which petitions my patience for consummation.
NOLAN
You speak of your patience and what of mine?
SHELAG
That is what I am trying to teach you, my love, patience.
NOLAN
I cannot struggle with these matters any longer. Nan is gone and we must make our way to help the fair Dymphna with her sorrow. 

SHELAG
All well and good yet what if the King does summon us to serve for amusement, for his sorrow’s distraction?






NOLAN
That is the service which defines our place here and if Damon bids our frolic for diversion then
we shall romp.

SHELAG
I believe I would not be capable of masking the sadness of this passing after speaking with Dymphna.
NOLAN
Your spirits did not seem suffered when you lit the fuse of my rage against Gerebern for the sake of a frivolity.
SHELAG
I knew not of our Lady’s demise until most recently.
NOLAN
Well, let us to her daughter and if you desire we shall make practice of our sport along the way, in case, our King does decide to recreate his court with our devilish wit.
SHELAG
Yes, let us to Dymphna yet say not that our wit is devilish for you are the only imp between us or should I say your limping leg’s the dibbuk?
NOLAN
I know many a word, yet have not eared that phrase.





SHELAG
The word did near my understanding when I was a wee colleen and some Israelite did goss of such unholy ghosts called dibbuk.
NOLAN
Anyhow, the book’s closed for now but perhaps you will be kind enough to have a read tonight.
SHELAG
Enough. Let us prepare and perhaps, perhaps I shall allow your leprechaun to lightning my skies.
INT – THE CHAPEL – CONTINUOUS
The Chantry is simple with a large table with an unadorned cross at the center.
Surrounding the sides, there are tall vigils burning gently.
Within the glow of  the candle light, Dymphna is meditating upon a prayer to G-d for the departed spirit of her mother. 
A few moments pass as she stands from the kneeling position which she has taken on the carved stone floor and starts or continues another adjuration.








DYMPHNA
Holy Spirit, Heavenly Father, Divine Healer of the Faithful my only Love Lord Jesus Christ I trust you have heard my prayer. I trust you hold my sweet and constant mother in the high kingdoms that are your Heavens even now as I grieve, as I observe her memory in the sanctuary that is mine own heart. 

I know there can be no response from your mouth that I could hear and yet I hear your affection in my blood, I see your answer in the vision of sacred lights before my reddened eyes, I feel the tingle of your powerful truth at the tip of my tongue, and I know that she is among your angels indeed she is among Ye. 

Yea. May it be so even if I cannot be there when mine own hour has claimed itself consumed. Dear Lord, I am only now becoming a woman in a world I fear will be torn between Gerebern’s teaching of your Conception, Incarnation, and Resurrection and Damon’s pagan ways. 

Indeed, I am to meet my earthly father tonight and I should here and now implore Your Grace and Wisdom that these should carry themselves instead of my words to his intellect and incite faith in his hard, battle-weary, and suffered soul.

The change I wish for him will only challenge his arrogance and pride with a conquering force tonight under the spell of your benevolence for he mourns as I do the eternal sleep of his consort.

INT – DAMON’S PRIVATE ROOM -EVENING 

Damon
You have not been here since the day I had good pythius bring out my finest steel, each tuck and each dirk. I would say you were six or seven, then. 
DYMPHNA
I was nine.
Damon
It seems a much longer time. How sad I was to hear that you held no interest in holding the sword you chose.
Dymphna
I learned well how to deal and turn for defending and perhaps for triumph.
Damon
Let us not squabble.
Dymphna
Let us not.
DAMON
We are here to give comfort and companionship to each other after such grief has given us the burden which would bend our backs with more weight than any overloaded sack.
Dymphna
Forget not father, that we are here especially to speak of matters of faith.




Damon
I do not forget and I will fail not to listen.
DYMPHNA
Truly an excellent combination. I did pray that it would be so.
Damon
Would it not be wise for us to sit and rest upon the sleeping tier.
DYMPHNA
Yes. It has been a day of sorrow and exhaustion has extended its weariness upon my shoulders.
DAMON
Here let me soothe your ache some as you tell me about your belief.
Dymphna
It is not my belief alone father, it is a faith that many share. As far south as the Egyptian lands. It is not something new, the Church of Christ is vast and surely its reach will only widen. 
DAMON
This I know well, for there are reports from my stags that some of these followers of that superstition have changed the names of some of our very own sacred divinities. How are my hands upon your pain?
DYMPHNA
Palliated yet it scathes my brain to hear you call my religion a superstition.




DAMON
Was it not some errant Jew that did upon an ass find his mount and was it not this Jew that claimed to give life upon death.

DYMPHNA
Yes and for his sacrifice we who believe find life eternal in his blood.

DAMON
And so, my lovely and learned daughter, you would have your own kind and caring father partake in the ways of vampires? By Camulus and Teranis, I have built a kingdom here and now for you and for me to enjoy as long as the days will allow and if my soldiers and servants instruct well enough to bring their sons and grandsons into service then here shall this very kingdom be eternal for your offspring and their hatchlings. Know you of any person dead that has returned and delivered a sermon for this Vampire of souls?

DYMPHNA
He did raise the dead. He Himself overcame the cross and He walks yet among his followers.









Damon
I have slain  crowds of men with my right arm and dozens more with my left. My steadfast Pythius, he has murdered many more than I and neither of us could say that any ghost did walk in or after any bloodshed. I am a reasonable man and I have great love for you and so I give you ear and listen but in my bones there is no bend as you should already well comprehend. Now, I want nearness between us and if somehow you could translate your faith for my understanding then I would erect a house of worship which we could visit together. 

Dymphna
What may I say to sate your hostility and alter your inclination?

DAMON
You may say that indeed it is only superstition, that there was belief before this Christ you proclaim and that there is not one path to salvation as there is not one path to death and you may explain as well why should I follow a cowardly martyr that did not follow his own tradition?







DYMPHNA
For love. For His Love you may live evermore with peace and tranquility. For He was not simply as you or I, Jesus was the awaited savior, the messiah born immaculate and risen to heaven through the same air we now breathe. Father, as your skeleton is strong so is my sense of this truth and so was mother’s and for love of us should you respect and accept our faith as your very own. 

Damon
What of my polemic?

DYMPHNA
He did follow his own tradition, but in a new way. In a manner that more could imitate and we that are moved by His holy example see that he was not a cowardly martyr as you have verbalized. He suffered condemnation and a criminal’s death that we might swim into the pleasant waters of free salvation. Believe me, father, I would not say untrue words and well you know that mother also did trust the Nazarene.

DAMON
If it is for love of mine own kin and tribe I do promise to give the matter exploration. Now, rest with me a while for the thought of my Nan has weakened me.







DYMPHNA
I will not stay long, for I wish to have another hour of prayer.

DAMON
You may pray beside me that I may learn the song.

DYMPHNA
Yes. Perhaps, that is only fair.

DAMON
You are so lovely in nearness.

DYMPHNA
I do not think I am exquisite. 

DAMON
My hand is blind and yet I can feel at the stroke of your body the beauty that curves and expands in breathing.

DYMPHNA
Wait. No. You should not handle me in such – I must go and I must with prayer amend this error.

DAMON
You cannot go, I cover you with my body and I covet you now. Give me your love my daughter as your mother did before.






DYMPHNA
My breathing is fast and I cannot think yet I cannot –  this cannot be.

DAMON
Forget your virginity here and now and become my woman. Take my manhood between your gentle thighs.
DYMPHNA
I will not – I shall not – Oh, Jesus unbind me from this quandary.

DAMON
Daughter, save your prayer for after penetration.

DYMPHNA
There will be no defloration. You will not deflower my chastity. By my virtue.

DAMON
Your refusal will turn my hair fainter than Finn Maccool  my Dymphna ah look how your chest does make the saliva in my mouth flame. It is the spitting image of your mother’s breast yet I see now that your pyramids are more pointed.

DYMPHNA
Better pointed now is the blade you yourself recently set alongside our bodies and surely you feel it at your throat as I feel your phallus stir back to a friendlier style. 





DAMON
You have neither the fire nor the fortitude to thrill for a kill.

DYMPHNA
As you have not the audacity to test my capacity.

DAMON
Away. Away. Go to your prayer, but I will have you for my wife.  

 EXT – DAMON’S BOTANY – CONTINUOUS
NOLAN and SHELAG are still entangled in conversation as they make their way through the path.
DYMPHNA is hurrying from the Royal houses, possibly to seek Gerebern.

NOLAN
There, there. Let us be gentle now for I do see our friend and master. 
Shelag
She must be starved for affection.
NOLAN
Sadly we may only provide the vitamins which although kind are not kin.
SHELAG
Hush now for she seems troubled.





NOLAN
Dear good friend, Dymphna. How may we ease your sorrow this evening.
DYMPHNA
My broken heart has been made heavier by actions which I cannot bear to uncover with words.
SHELAG
Our sympathy lies with you, if there is a clandestine matter you wish to leave within the sanctuary of our friendship then, fair Dymphna, know that we shall loiter and listen without lettering what you have shared upon other shoulders. 
NOLAN
I would let you two alone if it were a female issue.

DYMPHNA
It is nothing, perhaps it is simply the shock of having buried one so dear to me, to us -
SHELAG
Aye, dear as none other to us.
NOLAN
Affirmative. The Queen was the best of us.







Dymphna
Dear Nolan and dear Shelag, I do desire your society and yet I know it as sure as the hour is late that I must pray, I must meditate upon the imminent days and if there were a subject for our secluded space it would only be that you would both make yourselves available if He that guides and brings merriment into this growing home that is the body you see before your eyes leads me into to travel away from the lands of our King Damon.
SHELAG
Think not to trouble yourself with such a worry.
NOLAN
Nay. We will follow if your need is to float afar.
DYMPHNA
I thank you and I will keep you both within my prayers, now I should find the comfort of Gerebern to hear how he might illuminate the confused music which holds me unable to dance clearly.
NOLAN
I – I – Hate to -
SHELAG
His tongue’s a tied for he has been terribly tough in roughing up the preacher.






NOLAN
I – My – She was the one that – I saved his skin, my tongue’s untied as it ever was, well, let me not now exaggerate, it has been wedded to words since before I came to serve in this kingdom and if there is woe or ache upon the priest – well, look to the one with the longer hair.
Dymphna
Gerebern is harmed, is hurt, how?
SHELAG
It is true and it is partly I to blame yet hear me Dymphna even at your age you must know how foolish and unfair the stronger sex was ever and in these unfortunate times is. 
DYMPHNA
I know not what to say, where might I encounter him and his pain and join upon his peace.
NOLAN
We know not yet you should know that it was your own father our Righteous King Damon which did neglect all temper and trample his well-being. After that, I did expel some of his sting by stabilizing the stab and did bid him hurry to my home in the hope that he would  help instigate my wife into her womanly ways within our wedlock. It was then when he should have been enticing for my sake  that I found him provoking infidelity for his own. 





SHELAG
The day is not so long that should have already forgot my explanation and your own sense of chagrin for having pounded on the very passion you had availed with near precise remedy.
NOLAN
The day is now evening and that is among the  parts which have been memorized yet I was endeavoring toward an explanation of the how so that here Dymphna should well translate and not contemplate me as malefic.
SHELAG
Nolan, you are, as I proclaim and complain, yet a child. The young lady our fair Dymphna already surely knows all men though they be gentle or laureled are by nature malefic.

NOLAN
I would argue that none here is and our Right King is not.

SHELAG
You know not yourself and if you heed not my call for patience you never will and I dare not speak against our monarch yet he is a man. 







DYMPHNA
I would say the monarch is a man and I say it with rue upon the ripcord that has unfolded my regret at not having had more time with her that saw my insertion into the world. 
NOLAN
Portion me at least the part which will press ahead the search for Gerebern.
Dymphna
Yes. Yes, let us to my spiritual governor and do lead the way as I would holding hands with Shelag succeed.

SHELAG
My child you are cold, take my cloak and indeed let us hold hands and shuffle behind the stagger of Nolan as he searches for the usher.
NOLAN
I won’t stagger, although malevolent by nature, I have mastered the stride.








EXT – DAMON’S BOTANY – CONTINUOUS

DAMON
Pythius, Pythius, where is that sentry.
The King paces back and forth. 
Pythius
King Damon, I am here, I was spying that deviant couple, your court jesters, they went yonder with the young Dymphna.
DAMON
You say they are gone with the Princess.
PYTHIUS
Gone it seemed to me in search of Gerebern.
DAMON
Say not such impairing words if you know not in certainty for they make me harp on anger and I am all in the rage. 
Pythius
I may follow  the trail if it be your desire.
DAMON
Not by the rhyming hangman’s patty. 
PYTHIUS
Is that from the Filid’s book of Gwyn?
DAMON
  
My Sentry you have most likely read more than my eyes have paged. I know not nor recall where the phrase became familiar to me.



PYTHIUS
It matters not, yet not have ye said the reason for airing my name.
DAMON
In confidence you did reveal one of your pastimes as being held by the pleasure minx. 
PYTHIUS
As I said, when a coin is redundant.

DAMON
And when the cock has purpose.

PYTHIUS
Indeed.

DAMON
Indeed tonight my hammer is enticed to bang and I trust that these nails and pegs you pound are good and round, I say bring them all, I would like one tall and I would like one small and fear not for yourself for you will be purchasing with the medallion of the kingdom. 

PYTHIUS
The hour nears lateness. I cannot say if they are all uncommitted.

DAMON
Bring as many as the hour might procure. Make haste and in returning from your hurry give word to our troops that we shall pick apart and plunder the bordering tribe at first light.



Pythius
My good King, is there cause?

DAMON
There is not ever a reason for war nor is there ever a reasonable war. Tomorrow we shall say that our Holy Queen Nan was vexed by the evil henry of their stream which when overflowed salts our crops with their slack. 
Pythius
Carnality and carnage. May you reign forever.
EXT – OUTSKIRTS OF THE VILLAGE -
NOLAN
I believe that the priest is there.
SHELAG
I see not a figure in the darkness.
NOLAN
There, by the that thick tree to the left.
DYMPHNA
There is something that seems to stir slowly.
SHELAG
If you both do perceive the man then let us not argue the point. Nolan and I will stand here in wait while Dymphna delivers herself unto her Christian Druid.






DYMPHNA
If it is Gerebern, I will stay a while within his company and if it is not -
Shelag
And if it is not, then you shall shout or beckon us to rush to your side.
NOLAN
Indeed, we shall be at the ready and when you exchange words with the clergyman please do say how with a humble heart I do hope for his forgiveness.
Shelag
Say not the same for me, I do not seek his pardon at least not until he agrees to let me tame my mate in my own manner.
NOLAN
Need we transgress further against Dymphna’s tranquility with your stubbornness?

SHELAG
For once, perhaps, you are right and yes go easy to him and we shall be here at your bidding.








 
INT – DAMON’S PARLOR – CONTINUOUS 
PYTHIUS

I have brought from the harem all that were willing.

DAMON

Mine eyes they count more than enough cunts to cut my craving considerably well.


PYTHIUS
Are they too many?
DAMON

Nay. Take the ones those that you are accustomed to and any other you wish.
Pythius motions for some whores and they three gather to his side.
PYTHIUS
My good king, I will take these and leave you now with the long dozen to satisfy your desires.

DAMON
Be here before the day breaks with the garrison and we shall  go and break the sounds of peace.

Pythius exits along with his selection. Damon breezes a touch among the thirteen remaining prostitutes and leads them seductively into his bed chambers.



INT – DAMON’S  BED – CONTINUOUS
NORA
Our good king and master, how would we best please your desires?
DAMON
Encircle this sleeping cot with yourselves, except for you – you are -
Sheela

I am she that is called Sheela and I am entirely at your disposition.
Sheela just like Sheela Na Gig, well,  unrobe and lay there that I may behold your body and your love gadgets before I start to give suck to my lust.
SHEELA unrobes and places herself on his bed. The others surround her as King DAMON climbs upon his orgy against sorrow and loss.

EXT – OUTSKIRTS OF THE VILLAGE – Continuous
NOLAN and SHELAG are standing idle as DYMPHNA approaches the figure by the tree.
DYMPHNA
Gerebern, Gerebern, is it you there in the darkness.
GEREBERN
It is not and yet it is, young Dymphna.
DYMPHNA
Are you hurt, master.





GEREBERN
I am only afflicted by the dumbfounding blows that your father and his court jester did bestow on my person and I stand here with the uncertainty of why as I search my heart for the reason that our Lord and Savior would allow me to suffer in such ways as I could not have imagined.
DYMPHNA
It has been a terrible day and a horrid night. I must get you attended to before you lose yourself in this miserable condition.
GEREBERN
Here is the day I wanted to see, where you took the reign of our friendship and became yourself a master of compassion as you proclaim me to be and yet in all prayers I could not have expected the hour to be so otherwise filled with pain.

DYMPHNA
Speak no more and we shall get you well and show ourselves away from madness of my father the King which in its wrath did try to wrap me into unholy rapture. 
GEREBERN
Speak into my listening that I may know what did betide and then we’ll to prayers try to amend this wrong.





Dymphna
It was no more than a threat I turned away with hurry as we must now for your health. Let us to the hop clover and the healing hands.

INT –  PYTHIUS’S PLACE – CONTINUOUS
PYTHIUS
Minerva, you were as magical as ever. 
MINERVA
We are so near it is as if being with a husband. 
Pythius
I would agree and it might be that soon our good king will adorn me with the garment of marriage.
Minerva
Will I still have your companionship once in a while?
Pythius
It is most likely, particularly,  if it is you I wed.
Minerva
Let us make love once more before the dawn rises and these other girls awake. 
Pythius
I cannot please you or pursue my own pleasure as the minute approaches to engage in battle.
MINERVA
You will yourself to war without your forty winks?



Pythius
I have no need for rest or sleep as the fight will free me of distraction or longing for dreams.
Minerva
Shall I remain here to wait upon your return?
Pythius
Do as you will, if you are not here then I shall search for you when desire embraces my reality.


PYTHIUS puts on his battle clothes and carries himself to the King’s door. Along the way, other soldiers gather and march to await DAMON’S word. 
He motions to the infantry and watches them as they head out to plunder. The cavalry follows, himself mounted.
The force of his troops overwhelm the nearby village and although they offer resistance and some of the infantry fall wounded or dead, his victory is overwhelming.
They return carrying their spoils and new slaves. 
INT – GEREBERN’S STUDY– CONTINUOUS
DYMPHNA overlooks and is possibly in prayer as an attendant seeks to heal the priest. 









ATTENDANT
Dymphna, it does no good to have you lurking as I try to heal the ministrant.

DYMPHNA
It is only that I worry so yet if it should be best then I will find myself another place to pray for
The health of the good Gerebern.

ATTENDANT
Yes. I will do everything possible and although I have not said it, you must know that the passing of our great Queen has brought no peace  into my heart which was made sad by the news.
Dymphna
Sadness seems to succeed in more than sufficient amounts when it decides to arrive.
ATTENDANT
Sometimes, it is the unfortunate truth.
DYMPHNA
Well, then I shall leave you to heal this man and seek consolation with my good friends Shelag and Nolan.
ATTENDANT
I will send for your when he is well enough to make conversation.




EXT– BURIAL GROUNDS– LATER IN THE DAY
DAMON
They fled alike flames under the heavy waterfall.

Pythius
Aye, they fell like hollow branches.

Damon
 Have you information for me, trusted Pythius.
Pythius
Only that Gerebern is upon his bed with a nurse that attempts to make him better.
Damon
Are you too tired to join me as I confront the worm once more?
Pythius
I am renewed by the war and rather prepared to breathe awake long into the evening.
EXT – LOCATIONS NEED TO BE RE-SET, SAY THIS MIGHT BE THE BOTANY ONCE MORE – CONTINUOUS

NOLAN
After such a long and nearly unpleasant day, it would be fine and gentle of you to give your love to me tonight.

SHELAG
I will give you something but I doubt that it will be the touch you so seem to desire.

NOLAN
If not touch then surely something that will save me from complete despair, is there a gift which you have saved inside some corner where my searching eyes have overlooked inside our home. 

Shelag
You might say it is one of the more appropriate gifts that could be conferred upon your self.
NOLAN
You have got my curiosity, I know not if I will be able to handle the wait.

SHELAG
Your words are cute and they bring me a smile for you yourself shall see how they do rhyme with my purpose.
Nolan
I must then make a few minutes to pour refreshing waters upon this identity which has grown verdant with sweat and dingy from the dust of the nearby battle.
Shelag
If that is your pleasure, but you need not perfume your body for my pleasure.
NOLAN
For our pleasure, dearest yet unkind wife.
SHELAG
There comes the good Dymphna. Let us have no further talk of your Leprechaun making light upon my skies.



NOLAN
Lightning, dear love. 

DYMPHNA
Dear friends, how good it is to find you again. It seems that my Gerebern needs a longer while to heal and I have perhaps a while to wait.
SHELAG
Perhaps then we should entertain you with some rendition from our wits.
NOLAN
Bits, ladies, I am only up for bits.
DYMPHNA
I need only your kind companionship.

SHELAG
Bit, whole, or some beguiling sensation, you shall presently have at hand.

NOLAN
Let us then perform the paean of hangmen’s spirits.
SHELAG
It will not amuse as a bit.







NOLAN

We shall hem, hair, and hen and see how much of the whole our hype will deliver.

SHELAG
Behold, fair and kind Dymphna!

NOLAN
Starved was the executioner when he himself got home after a long day of rope and crucifixion.

SHELAG
He? Nay, the slayer was a she?

NOLAN
Only a woman  would pump such a doubt into a phrasing already in motion.

SHELAG
Skillful raconteur, I am not a woman now, I am one of the them which that  woman did  remove from her existence.

NOLAN
I dare say she was no woman, I have read the history and she was a man.

SHELAG
How can your tongue’s logic be so twisted to say that she was a man, being that it was a she then surely it was a woman and I was there.


NOLAN
And how could you have been there and be now here. It is a terrible contradiction to logic.
SHELAG
I am here in spirit,in spite of logic, you will agree.
Nolan
I do see yet I know not if I agree.
SHELAG
Touch me and your hand will know that the flesh you see is harvested from your imagination.
Nolan
Although nearly a beauty and pretty as a pink peach  you truly  are as slippery as a salmon yet that is not proof enough for me to agree that you were there and under the slayer’s departing spear. 
SHELAG
Dear raconteur, I would take offense at your judgment if I was not so certain that I am not nearly a beauty but beautiful  for it was my comeliness that did cause my death at the hand of the executioner whose own demise you are trying to recite under the dying light of this day. 

NOLAN
I nearly had disremembered the intention of my talk to divulge his most ironic destiny.
SHELAG
Her, her. It is always the same with you men. Distractions blind you to your own purpose.



Nolan
Starved was the executioner when she himself got home after a long day of rope and crucifixion.

Finding neither meat nor soup he or as the reasonably bonny yet slithery and frigid ghost of one victim here does bemoan  she did graze on corn grits cold with such distraction from hunger that the assassinating entity overlooked the very venom which those lynching paws had themselves positioned for the intention of some devious slaughter planned as a side project for it is said that the decapitator had grown much too restless with only the required removal of life yet the chain-smoke chewing prevented that murder and so also ended for a while the capital punishment in that land. 

SHELAG
I had wondered how it was that she did disappear into the land of perdition. 

Nolan
As I wonder how you have appeared in this land of trick and trump.
SHELAG
Only women know such ways and I will not say to a man that doubts my grace although talented in story.




Nolan
Your fineness is not the question, it is the matter of your corporal self which trounces me.
Shelag
For that I have this.
NOLAN
Ah, a shriveled caput!
SHELAG
That one is my own, see how divine I was before my death.
NOLAN
Yes, lovely and light.
SHELAG
If your intention’s to juggle, there should be more than one.
NOLAN
Have you more?
SHELAG
I have.
NOLAN
Heads in the air, your own once fair.
SHELAG
Skull under sky, aren’t we? all I say.
DYMPHNA
I say, splendid, your sparing stage with hangman, spirit, and deathtrap did delight me so that I did for a time not recount the trouble which tempts my tears. Get yourselves to your own pleasures as I make my return to Gerebern’s side.




Nolan
It is our pleasure to please, especially-
Dymphna
Especially, when it is you, our good friend Dymphna.

INT– GEREBERN’S STUDY – CONTINUOUS

Pythius
Stand aside healer, your king wants exchange with the priest.
Attendant
Gerebern is not well enough to make responses.
Damon
I need not hear his talk for my intention is not conversation.
Pythius
Stand aside, I say, or these will be the last words your servant ears will hear resounding.
Damon
You look as if death would be a pleasing state instead of this dreary suffering.
Gerebern
There is more to me than the flesh you behold.
Damon
Produce this more and it shall presently expire under my vengeance.



Gerebern
It is my soul. The soul’s invisible and mine has been saved by the holy blood of Jesus. 
Damon
Then you are well prepared to make your departure as my sword is already deviled and well disposed to stamp out your existence.
Gerebern
I shall pray for you.

Damon
Pray not for me, I have power and no need for any plea to some erratic Jew that awaits the souls of the feeble, the delicate, and the frail.
Gerebern
At least let me say one orison before striking me down.
DAMON
Have you not already made your god’s ear crimson with the trifle of your petitions, enough, say nothing and I too shall be concise with my cut.
Pythius
You cannot enter, your father, the king, entertains the preacher.
Dymphna
You are bound by custom to obey my command and I say let me through.
Attendant
He will not allow it, Gerebern may already be murdered.



Dymphna
Father, Father, let my guide be free and you shall have me as you have requested.
Pythius
I am bound to obey and yet I cannot heed the order which stems from pity instead of logic and allegiance to the king.
GEREBERN
Even now, the grace of the Lord protects me.
DYMPHNA
It is not your place to say from where my instructions are inspired, soldier. Father.
 Damon
Pythius, how is it that this deed is now crowded with distraction?
Pythius
King Damon, I have not words to explain such confusion, being torn between by respect to your daughter and honor to yourself.
Damon
What says she that only loves me in moderation?
Pythius
She screams to spare the life of that worm and does wager that your request will be executed.
Damon
Let her come near.






Gerebern
My Dymphna, make no bargain with this Beelzebub.
Damon
Silence, maggot.  Or the ants will feast upon your other hand.
Dymphna
No. Father, no. Hurt not further the gentle Gerebern. I have – I will this very night please you as you desire. 
Damon
Break your word and I shall most displeased.
Dymphna
Sentry, let the attendant pass.
Damon
Pythius, comply and let us impart ourselves away from this compassion. Dymphna, bring yourself to me tonight. 
Dymphna
I will be there. 
INT – SHELAG’S PLACE – LATER
NOLAN
I dare say, that now that you’ve agreed to act with wifely comportment, I find there are butterflies making my nerves flutter.






Shelag
Flummoxed by fear at the reality of a nearing satisfaction.
Nolan
I said not fear. Tis excitement, it is natural.

Shelag
I expect, after all your supplications, it will be something a bit beyond the mere natural.

Nolan
Let us to the dark and there we shall make with spontaneous lust some sweet miracle for our own pleasures, my beloved Shelag.
Shelag
I hear someone’s approach.
Nolan
Say no more, say not another delay.
SHELAG

I speak not against the lay, yet listen.

Nolan
There is only irony in life.
Shelag
Dymphna, what is the matter?
DYMPHNA
Oh, Shelag, I hate to destroy your peace, to disturb your patience, but I have no one else to turn to.



SHELAG
How is it that I might help?

NolAN
She may board here while we resume our romance.

SHELAG
Quiet, Nolan, or we shall not ever continue that conversation.

DYMPHNA
Gerebern has been further injured by my father and I must take him and myself away from here for he will slay him when he finally understands that I will not be his wife.

Shelag
His wife?

Dymphna
I ask that you help me bring myself and Gerebern far away where my father cannot follow.
SHELAG
I will need a few moments to ready and Nolan -

NOLAN
I know where a boat might take us into the safety of distance. 




EXT – THE SHORE – DAWN -

Nolan
Setanta. Setanta, how good it is to see you my Setanta.
SETANTA
Nolan, you are in a hurried herd and yet you look as handsome as ever.
Nolan
One of us is hurt and all of us are escaped from the confines of King Damon never to return, I pray to Mac Og that your boats are set for sail.
SETANTA
Only two are left and only one is set for voyage. I say you may have it, yet there must be coin for the couple that will carry my vessel home.

Nolan
Dymphna, now is the time to bargain, I would say it would be wise to let Shelag argue over price yet it is best to make haste and I am certain that my old friend will be fair.
Setanta
I am already being kind in not exacting a tax for my own purse.
Dymphna
I have not coin, yet I have these rings which are each a treasure be they traded or worn.




SETANTA
Natosvetta, Sirona, make your choice of one of these, take the third to swop for supplies, and prepare the longboat to take these four across the water whichever way the waves are best.

INT – PYTHIUS’s– MORNING
DAMON
Pythius, for breakfast I have made the attendant into a corpse and I want you to ride and find me information or location about my daughter.
Pythius
I am on my way.
Damon
Take the entire cavalry, if you are so moved and send messengers along the way. 
Pythius
Great King, I know that some of these events bring your mind trouble, but I must say how thrilling it is to have more exhilaration and in particular your confidence. I shall not let you down. 









EXT– THE SEAS– LATER THAT DAY-
SIRONA
I thought our life was hard, Nantosvetta, but one look at these four and I feel as if I were on top of the world. That priest looks as if he won’t make it across.
NANTOSVETTA
Sirona, you are always making judgments. Make something else, we have many knots yet to sail.
SIRONA
Hearing your words, I gather the meaning, yet could it not be also jealousy since I mitched your invitation last night and bunked with Setanta.
NANTOSVETTA
Not ever would I be in envy of the likes of you since you are much like myself and as far as Setanta, well, she is our overlord and I have had you both enough to amuse my memory for months besides there is more music in the world than coition.
SIRONA
That might be so, but without those notes the playing’s all tedium and travail. Look at the girl’s countenance, it seems a luminosity without the brightness of love’s bliss.





NANTOSVETTA
Obviously, my words reach not your psyche, if you are to contaminate my serenity with conjectural adjudication then I shall catapult into the ocean where the talk bubbles voiceless.

INT – DAMON’S – THE NEXT DAY-
MESSENGER
King Damon, I have word from Pythius for your ear.
DAMON
Tell me only if the hour has arrived for me ride.
MESSENGER
It is so. He holds a captive and awaits your response.
DAMON
Lead me to them.
EXT– THE SEAS– EVENING
Nolan
Shelag, at last I hold within my arms.
Shelag
Quiet, you’ll awaken the others.
NOLAN
They are all fast asleep save for the two sailors, lift your hedge that my harmonizer might at long last hum the chord of copulation.





SHELAG
I will lift not now nor will I while we defend the good and fair Dymphna, you will have to wait and learn the patience that is appropriate for a husband.

Nolan
Then I shall employ my grip and smatter your side with my unwanted matter.
SHELAG
Husband, I know you are starved for my affection yet hold on to your enthusiasm and you shall be rewarded, listen not to lust’s nag for we are in the nearness of one that is a paragon of perfection and moreover she is our friend. 
Nolan
All my days and nights are the word delay indeed delay with accentuation upon the prefix while the suffix goes unseasoned. De, De, De. Removing or reducing by land or by water all I know is delay.
EXT – THE SHORE – CONTINUOUS
DAMON
What is the situation, Pythius.







PYTHIUS
This here is Setanta and she is one of those Sapphic monsters that lives by fish and voyage. I have introduced her to the sweet horror of penetrations and I removed her forefinger when she did attempt to raise it before my eye. It now adorns her hair. 
DAMON
What of the information, my loyal and overzealous sentry.
PYTHIUS
She will not speak of it, she says only her friend your Jester did for Spain set course in mourning after an argument with his spouse subsequent to the Queen’s passing. 
DAMON
Lesbo, I am certain my soldier has hurt you and I see it in your eyes, before I ask him if he would like another pass at your pussy or another finger to better decorate your salted head, let me warn you that his wrestling against your tranquility was and will be nothing in contrast to the wrenching pain you will suffer under my attack if I am not satisfied that you have said all there is that I  wish to know.










EXT– BELGIUM – 
Dymphna
I thought no land could be as beautiful as my Emerald Isle. 
Shelag
None is as exquisite as our Erin, yet there is exceptional poetry here in this port of call that shall give us haven from the hell we eloped.
Nolan
I thank you both for leading us here and bid you a safe journey back.
Sirona
All in a day’s work and anything for a comrade of our Setenta.
NANTOSVETTA
Perhaps on some other occasion you and your lovely pretty will visit and we too shall be better friends.
Nolan
Most likely, I will make it a point to insist on that jaunt when we are settled. Give my regards to her that awaits your return.   
Dymphna
It was not hell only the horror that man himself might create with his self-serving malignancy.
SHELAG
We are a world away from woe, my dear Dymphna.





DYMPHNA
I always knew I would somewhere travel and yet I knew not it would be this way. Let us find shelter for as surely as the light grows dark in evening  Gerebern’s still grizzled from wound and wend.
EXT – THE SEAS–  EVENING
DAMON
Pythius, upon our return, you shall have the gentle maiden for a wife that I did oath.

PYTHIUS
I thank you my good King and I hope that when we are free of this quest you shall have all that is quintessential to your inclinations.

DAMON
Awake me when our improvised pirate expedition has gained the ground to where they  that would deign to mutineer against myself have absconded.










EXT – BELGIUM – DAY

Nolan
Shelag, Shelag.
Shelag
We have already made love and there is no need for such exuberance, my good husband and now practiced bowman.
Nolan
I squall not for the aching joy around my squirter, darling Shelag but for having spied the King himself with at least a sixer of soldiers at his side.
Shelag
Hurry, we must make haste.

INT – The Cottage – Continuous
Gerebern
You three should thunder away as a flying storm and I will detain or derail their path as best as I can.
DYMPHNA
We all came not  this far and  away to have one sacrificed for uncertain anxiety. 






NOLAN
Dymphna is right, we must make our stand together and observe what our king intends for in your yet unfit condition there is not much resistance you could offer.

GEREBERN
I have the power of Jesus in my heart.

Nolan
That is well and good and take no insult from me for it was I that lead us to safety yet a Jesus in the heart is no stronghold against a bastion of blows that seeks to deck the cloth as I myself have proved against your health.

Shelag
I say, sex has made you surrender the logic of your tongue.

Nolan
The logic’s perfect -

SHELAG
Perhaps, yet above all things do employ tact for the sake of our princess.

Nolan
There is no time for tact, there’s hardly time for talk. 






Dymphna
Shelag, Nolan is although misguided by lack of faith correct yet he himself shall witness the true strength which belief in Christ does confer upon his followers and worry neither for tact nor time. Both of you have been sweetly delicate to me. 


EXT– THE COTTAGE– CONTINUOUS

DAMON
Daughter, you have broken your word, you have run away instead of honoring your vow. I am here in person to return you to your place.
Gerebern
You shall have to empty the blood from me cruel pig.
DAMON
The only pigsty is the spaying order to which you belong, you giant louse.
GEREBERN
You will rot in the fire of eternal damnation.
DAMON
I did not think the day would bring me laughter, Pythius.
PYTHIUS
At your command.





DAMON
Remove the part of the worm’s body that produces words and let us see if this blood it speaks of having is ruby or jade.
Pythius
Should I decapitate or simply circumcise the tongue?
DAMON
The thing might bite your hand and infect you with faith, cut off the head.
Pythius
Gerebern, I will make it quick. 
GEREBERN
In the Holy name of Jesus, harm not my Dymphna.
Pythius
King Damon, how good it is to still carry a sword made by the Spaniard that once was among your slaves. 
DAMON
They are such a yearning and artsy race and yet indeed those were good swords, perhaps when this is done we shall find others for such tasks. 
Our own kinsmen have been too watered down by the wine of barley and that of murphies to make such  a shrewd weapon of murder.







DAMON
Yes. Yet no others are as willed as we.
 
No. None. Now, hold the head a while at hand that horror might overcome the others and bring my daughter to her senses.
Pythius
I am here to serve.
DAMON
Dymphna, produce yourself that you may take your mother’s place at my side. 
Nolan
King Damon, it is I your own servant the court jester. 
DAMON
I have no want for amusement now, retainer. 
NOLAN
I am not here to volunteer entertainment, but to entreat your highness to kindness.
DAMON
Have I not always been charitable to yourself and to your Shelag, Nolan?
Nolan
I cannot say the contrary was ever true and yet if nothing ever more your goodness grant us forgiveness and let her find her own way in the world.




DAMON
For your years of service and respect I grant your forgiveness as well as your wife yet the girl is mine and her way in the world will only be under my command until she herself rules my kingdom.
PYTHIUS
Be gone lest ye find your top hanging alongside this one that was recently toppled.
Damon
Daughter, unshadow yourself and stand by the shade of your father the king.
Dymphna
You have slain a holy man and you mock his spirit with your sentry.
DAMON
I meant no more than to have you near. 
DYMPHNA
We were once near and yet I cannot know the intimate nearness of your wicked design for my only love was destined me by Nan my mother and your once loved Queen and wife to serve beneath the blessings of Christ.
DAMON
Christ. See how your Christ has delivered Gerebern. Speak no more to me of Church or destiny.
DYMPHNA
Then we shall not speak, father.
Damon
Pythius, throw the head aside and shave the child of her freedom.


PYTHIUS
Come with me, Dymphna. I should not want to beat upon a beauty.
Dymphna
You have already crushed a goodly crown and you will not gain the ground that holds me now.
Pythius
Damon, she is an imp, I cannot stir myself to invade.
DAMON
Nonsense, she is radiant yet it is your own phantasy which has you stagnated.
DYMPHNA
It is the divine, the strong yet steady pattern of my religion that makes your soldier snared with insane attire.
DAMON
I would agree that religion disarms men of their wits yet Pythius surely is simply overcome by mercy.
DYMPHNA
It would do you a world of well to let your wisdom wander within belief instead of doubt.
DAMON
I believe I have always been good and just – and just now I have given my clemency to Nolan and his Shelag. I believe you should now be good and lead me not to further anger. I believe it is time you became my queen as Nan was before.




DYMPHNA
Your reign shall be without me.
Damon
It is my heart’s inviting, Dymphna.

DYMPHNA
Your heart is a nightmare that would bring me shame.
DAMON
Shame, you divest me of the greater portion of my dignity by leaving as I started to make a stand against the painted air of grief and still you would have my affection starved.
DYMPHNA
You want only to thieve me from divinity for your own pleasure. 
DAMON
I am so hurt that now I wish only to harvest your grave. 
Pythius
Do not slay Dymphna, she is your daughter.
Damon
Silence, Pythius. 
Dymphna
Father, I will supplicate the Savior for your salvation that someday we shall be as we were truly meant to be.
