Two men sit at the bar, one is dressed in a suit with a christless cross of gold clearly visible seemingly in place of a necktie and the other is dressed in black with a silver pentagram nearing his stomach -

Otherwise, they look similar -

1:	PAUL
I agreed to meet you, but I don't need to hear your point of view, I know you're opinion and its sinful, plain sinful.

2:	OLIN
That's a laugh! You are the ones that are supposed to be forgiving and accepting yet you call me sinful for voicing the praise of Satan.

3:	PAUL
It's not voicing, you are a televangelist - oh hell, no - a telesatanist for crying out loud -all fire and brimstone except its for Lucifer!

4:	OLIN
I like to think of myself as a telehellzapoppin' - anyway, all I want from you is to visit for a segment allow me to visit your church in return hey we've got a new sponsor in robinhood you might even get some free stocks, come on -

sometimes i nearly want to let an

know there's no telling where it

might come down...the mountains,

moldova, montana...there might be

even now i feel them listening even

spend all night searching for it

only to find a heat rash that

leaves you looking like elvis after

eating too much chocolate - how can

i trust her well i do but how can i

trust that the foes are not

invading, misdirecting,

manipulating...shit i have to

cancel that subscription, fifteen

dollars but at least now i am

certain that nudity is only

titillating not attractive...

write it was nothing, i was

waiting, yes another woman, but

that one made me lie, no way into

any truth without blowing her cover

and so i altered a few details in

my journal, in my diary but it was

getting too political and my own

bitterness felt too sour to share

on the page...strange how it sort

of reflects - is this retrospect -

that missing woman, one look at the

timeline and i knew she was dead

trun off the tape...it's going to

get impossible to balance religion

demonology, aliens, and

Well get on with it, child, 'fore your passport expire.

17:		BOARDING AGENT Everything seems to be in order, we will have to open up your backpack as there have been avocado smugglers lately-

They open his backpack as he notices their faces, they remind him of the house, of that room. He shakes at the thought - a man full of trauma without a reasoning thought in his head except for the echo repeat of the street vendors...black soil, black soil...he can feel himself fading as if he were a projection and someone turned off the projector...a woman folded up in a bloody suitcase flashes through his thoughts, children drowning, flailing into quiet bubbles that foam away,his fading now feels like falling, a crippling descent which ends back at that house, back at that room...

Are you aliens! Vampires? I can feel you biting me even now! Let me go and who the hell smuggles avocados!

As for, who or what we are well, Arthur - there's no such thing as aliens, there were sure but you have heard of the atomic bomb, no? Yes, all for them - imagine they wanted to build up new pyramids claiming the old ones were too near to traffic where were their jewish slaves and so on and so forth for a while the camps distracted them but in the end it had to be a case of extermination i mean surely in your position you get the importance of religion as i have heard you cry out oh god, oh boy did i get a kick out of playing that one back - hmm and to conclude my response to that question of yours, while we do enjoy the taste of blood we are not vampires - you could say we are scientists yes people of science -

Inside lizzy stands and slaps the writer hard without a word-then rushes to the door and pulls the eye piece from the headset as two of her mates rumble with the man in the grog ninja suit - others arrive and the van takes off - inside the musician grabs the brick and returns to the writer -

THE girl is suddenly submerged in a pool of water, she is holding a yellow bird just above the wavws, art is beside her but is not a good swimmer - beyond them military men ar shooting at eachother - some of the bullets as if disappearing do not wound as one soldier runs around like a madman - years ago - designer vagina real name aya - ayalet glaser -is at play trying to make her toy dolls eat, of course, they cannot eat -she is frustrated, undresses one, inspecting and turning it back even upside down the yogurt is thrown aside casting a jackson pollock effect upon the floor - later at a restaurant in what seems to be a graduation party everyone is eating while she sits there perhaps remembring her dolls and the strange realization that they didnt eat, couldn't eat - her voice can be heard what does it matter if im thin, is it illegal not to eat, et cetera -

Now back in present time the spoon seems in freeze frame in front of her face, her large eyes behind the octogonal frames blink as if not entirely certain of the meal, of feeding herself - the phone rings and the spoon crashes upon the table almost mirroring the earlier scene with the dolls -

She stands, appearing extre,e;y thin, visibly shaken yet soon enough starts to answer -

A10. NOTE INTERMISSION -

It seems nearly certain now that i am writing two screenplays, one is dream love story, surreal yet somehow factual - the other a murder mystery wherein a sort of corporate entity spy agency behind curtains has gained access to surveillance equipment beyond human inagination -

However since the play is yet unedited and free flowing or fluid then it might stil;l be chopped down to a single file with certain scenes shortened to accomodate what might be considered a film worth the viewing time - presently at an hour or half more if the dialogue is well paced - i like what i have -

A few days ago I escaped a coven of vampires with my friend the writer - we split up but they are holding another friend of mine- they also now have captured some spies so might have even more technology i don't know but i was at the dorm the same dorm that some high ranking creep bugged maybe with the asian triad or who the hell knows -but i got one of them except the cell phone evaporated out of the blue - mia told me about you and before i get to mexico i thought you should know all this - it's not that im afraid of the vampires but whoever was running that shit show i mean i think - i feel threatened - as soon as i got involved mia told me they cut off the water in her apartment you know like a signal or something sure it sounds paranoid or even insane but before we split up you know the writer he had this idea that all this had been going on way before - he said there had been a girl stabbed to death near the campus and that that was played out in the press as if some kids had done it but he thinks they were acting like government robots - unconscious agents activated against her in case she had information that would have uncovered this whole thing long before you had to leave -

The room where we both happened to crash at had been home to two students, we suspect one was like those three kids controlled and the other made to puppet in a sort of manipulated enrollment, registration, and freshmen indoctrination as a type of sideshow entertainment for a select group of men, possibly even one man -

As we started to look at the situation, a bomb squad was called in as if confirming the weirdness of it all - he pauses as if remembering something -then notes the girl from two years before was in the adjacent college but both dorms and universities are side by side, that easily interchangeable in terms of location -in any case, days after the squadron a graduate student was murdered northwest of the location of the first killing - reportedly by a member of a neverbeforeheardof gang, every body killer -

documentary on the mix-down-battles, well here it is MDB intro - This year marks the halfpoint centennial of a war which is won but by no means over. The merger between Microsoft and the United States military has proven its success in Austin. From 1400 mexicans in 2179 to 24 and diminishing in 2180. It is safe to say that by the end of this year Austin will be the first mexican-free zone. We must not forget Donald Trump, not only as president but as forerunner in building walls and shooting the invading hordes. The stumbling blocks of later democratic policies with a liberal agenda gave rise to the human meat markets, they argued against walls and bullets, insisting that it was more humane to let them in -process them for canned consumption - dog food - cat food - and yes it was later found that tastier portions were served in jails, airplanes, and hospitals but we cannot blame the doctors as they were blinded by the need for spare parts as it were - nevertheless the mexican population increased in the south and even as far north as the carolinas - This increase led us directly, collectively to employ biological controls - obviously the declassified files now reveal the folly of corona and its varients from omicrom to syl as the test stage for world uniformity - a sort of premature ejaculation of the master plan- some still protest but no one is complaining in texas. Now then, mixmajorka proved itself highly effective with minimal side effects to those outside the target group - of course mexicans are hot blooded even superstitious and in their own curious way even stopped

Of course of course -- like the musician I only wanted to sell some records -- the screenplay is a byproduct of creativity, creativity and some desire to surpass the common limits of self --

There is an entrance and then a another door - he goes into the room - the door shuts and he is surrounded by room full of similar robots, these appear less shiny but more sophisticated with some type of keypad in the chest area and light buttons along the side of the right arm - there is a calendar he notices the date -

I am going to get laid in mexico city -

The drones rattle and he turns to find himself in bed dreaming of tati nova - he thinks he is in new york and calculates the three hour difference as if to not wake her up and settles down contemplating the scene as if replaying it to remember but awakes later in a dissolve that rises only worried about ants or vampires at the door which he looks at again as if for the first time -

Look i dig it that you feel you went into a time travel thing, but you've read too many russian novels, this is the movies and the movies is not only what is in the light but what is left out - I'm looking at two hours as it is and we have enough for a cutting edge r rated film now look at it this way if i go for every hook well it's like nudity a bit too much and you get x rated, i mean it could be last tango in paris but it could be porn and there is no box office in porn.

The writer slams the phone down and screams -

The camera fades out to black then grey then white and runs back through the final edit in reverse quicktime until the easy dawn cafe except there is nobody there -
