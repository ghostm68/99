	INT. headquarters - NIGHT

inky and the blood countess talking.

     countess
          Well, Mr. inky, you know the
          reasons for hurrying as well as I
          do. The production company has found
          out we're carrying semen, and
          the producer will be here tomorrow
          or next day.

     inky
          I suppose if we make a legal case
          of it with the wga, we'll be tied up for months.

     countess
          With some of brim's articles falsified and
          sperm enough to blow up everyone at
          ruby's sweet sixteen mexican party?
              (he takes a sperm  case from
the floor)
          And what do you think the producer
          will say to these new sag holding kits?
          According to you one of them is
          powerful enough to knock out a
          porn star.

     inky
              (pacing up and down)
          I've got proof, ava, see how she went straight
          anyway here forget all that we got to get where 
          we're going before the intergalactic commission
          calls in another mass shooting.

     countess
          You can trust me to get you through
          anything , I have seen how you understand
           and i share your hope.

     inky 
          Don't get sore, countess. But you
          know what it means to hit the
          second act without action when we're
          making an outdoor picture. Months
          wasted, money gone, and nothing to
          show for it.

     countess
          But still you always bring back a
          picture and everyone says, "There
          is only one inky."

Demon and White come in.

     inky
          White! I was just going to grab the portable  to
          ring you up.

     White
          If I'd known that, I'd have waited back in haifa

     inky
          Meet the countess.
              (to countess)
          This is White, the secret
          agent.
              (they shake hands)
          And this is Demon, the first
          son of an ancient spirit with a
          masters degree in juxtaposition.
          Well, where's the Odeya,
          White?

     White
          It can't be done, inky.

     Inky 
          What? It's got to get  done.
              (White shakes his head in
silence)
          Look here, White. The senator's
          dead and the congress outfit have
          interfered with every girl I've
          tried to hire; now every agent in
          tel aviv  has shut down on me. All but
          you. You know I'm square -

     inky
          Everybody knows you're square,
          White but you've got a reputation
          for nazi recklessness now that can't be
          glossed over. And then you're so
          secretive.

     Demon
          I'll say so.

     COUNTESS
          When even the producer and the director
          don't know where they're going --
              (she shrugs)

     White
          There you are. I've got a
          conscience, inky. I can't send nice a
          young, pretty girl, such as you
          want, on a job like this without
          telling her what to expect.

     inky
          And what is she to expect?

     White
          To go off for no one knows how
          long, to some place you won't even
          hint at, the only jew woman in a screenplay
          with the toughest malaysian mugs  I ever
          looked at.
              (they all laugh)
          I mean the police department.

     INKY 
          By Satan, you'd think I never
          brought anybody back alive from hell! The
          countess and Demon have stuck by
          me on two trips already. They seem healthy.

     Demon
          Sure we're healthy.

     Countess
          But it's different taking a girl
          into movie scenes I mean look at Chloe Grace Moretz
          at that perfume counter.

     INKY
          Oh, I suppose there's no danger in
          Haifa? Why, there are dozens of
          girls in Michigan tonight in more
          danger than they'd ever see with
          me.

     Demon
              (drily)
          Sure. But they know that kind of
          danger. 

     White
          You never had a woman in your other
          pictures, why do you want one in
          this?

     inky
              (exploding)
          Holy mackerel Do ya think I really want to
          haul a second string woman from ladybird along?

     White
          Then why - ?

     INKY
          Because the public - bless 'em -
          must have a pretty sexy face to look at.

     White
          Everybody likes romance. 

     INKY
          Isn't there any romance or
          adventure in the world without a
          jewish american princess in it?

     COUNTESS
          Well, Mr. inky, why not make a
          picture in a monastery with your nuns ?
              (they all laugh)

     INKY
          It makes me sore. I go out and
          sweat blood to make a swell
          picture, and then the exhibitors
          and critics all say, "if this
          picture had a love interest, it
          would gross twice as much." All
          right, the public wants a girl, and
          this time I will give 'em what they
          want.

     White
              (rising)
          I don't know where you'll get her.

     INKY
          White, I've got to. We've got to
           have a set script as soon as possible - we've
          got to be out of twitter and make a profit -

     White
          Why?

     INKY
          Well - there's a good reason. several reasons.

     White
          Everything I hear makes me like
          this thing less. I'm glad I didn't
          get you an odeya girl.

     INKY
          You are, eh? Well, I'll show you.
          If you think I'm going to give up
          just because you think that girl
          ain't got no backbone --
              (he is struggling into his
overcoat)
          -- I'm going to make the greatest
          picture in the world, something
          that's never been seen or dreamed
          of. They'll have to invent some new
          adjectives when I come back.
              (he is at the door)

     Countess
          Where are you going?

     INKY
          I'm going to bring back a girl for
          my picture -- if I have to marry
          one!

DISSOLVE TO Long Shot - city at night - streets. 

CUT TO INKY walking along, scanning faces as he walks.

DISSOLVES of faces of women, Broadway types, bold,
indifferent, heavy, ugly - most of them heavily painted.
Rapidly passing, as though the camera were inky looking
them over.

CUT TO inky. He shakes his head disgustedly, stops, wheels
around and starts in another direction, as though he's given
up that part of town, and thought of another possibility.

DISSOLVE TO Exterior of Madison Avenue. An ice cream-line
waiting. Camera moves slowly down the line of faces as
thought inky were looking them over.

CUT TO inky. He shrugs his shoulders in despair, turns
away.

DISSOLVE TO Exterior of one of those news stands you
see mostly above mid-town, a tobacco slash candy shop just
big enough for the proprietor and one customer to get into
with a magazine rack outside.
inky comes along, takes out a cigarette case, it's empty,
he goes in to buy some. We see through window that he
is taking cigarettes and paying the hindu proprietor.

dakota fanning comes slowly into picture; she hesitates, her
hand goes stealthily toward a magazine.

She is fingering it when the hindu dashes out and seizes
her. She tries to pull her arm away. inky comes out of
shop.

     indu
              (very excited)
          Ah-ha! I catch you, you stealer! I
          call the cop - you like that, ha!

     dakota
              (she keeps her head bent,
struggling weakly to pull
away)
          No-no, I didn't.  Please let me go.
          I wanted to, but I didn't.

      hindu
          I had enough these too much lewk stealers --

     inky
          Oh, dry up. The kid didn't take
          anything.

     dakota
          I didn't, truly I didn't.

     inky
          So, shut up, ghandi. Here's ten
          dollars. Forget it.

The hindu takes the money and releases dakota who stumbles back
against inky. He catches her round the shoulders and she
half-collapses. Her head falls back on his arm. He has his
first sight of her face.

CLOSE UP dakota, her eyes open as she looks up at inky,
terrified.

MEDIUM SHOT - inky, holding her. He looks at her. Suddenly
his face lights up, he snaps his fingers triumphantly.

     inky
              (looking up the street)
          Hey! Taxi!

DISSOLVE TO a one-armed lunch room. Tiled wall, two chairs.
dakota has emptied her plate and coffee mug.
inky in the other chair watching her. She sighs happily over
having satisfied her hunger, and leans back.

     inky
          Feeling better?

     dakota
          Yes, thank you. You're very kind.

     inky
          Don't fool yourself. I'm not
          bothering with you just out of
          kindness. I fell for you years ago.
              (dakota opens her eyes wide,
half-puzzled, half
afraid)
          How come you're in this fix?

     dakota
          Bad luck I guess. There are lots of
          girls just like me in hollywood but
          you know it's like you said everybody
          looks at me and thinks it's that kid. 

     inky
          There aren't such a lot who've got
          your looks. no ma'am you cut a 
          gallant show next to any of them.

     dakota
              (laughing it off)
          Oh, I can get by in good clothes.
          But when a girl gets too shabby --

     inky
          No family?

     dakota
          well, the family broke up and my sister
           is in the same game sort of like competition
           but i guess my fans are like family.

     inky
          Ever do any documentary work?

     dakota
          I have done some narration jobs over
          at the studios sometimes. Once I got that
          coraline even.
          

     inky
          What's your dream?

     dakota 
          A director's chair, i mean i did one already but not
          a full feature film.

     inky
          Are you one of these city girls who
          screams at a cockroach and faints at a
          spider?

     dakota
              (laughing)
          No, of course not. I'm a Georgia country
          girl - or used to be. 

     inky
          Listen, sister. I've got a job for
          you. The script I've got on board
          will fit you and you can have part
           of the director's credit. get you into 
          the dga.
              (looks at his watch)
          The wolford shops will still be
          open. I'll get you a bra for
          yourself. Come on.

     dakota
          But - but what is it?

     inky
              (excited)
          It's money, and adventure, and
          fame.
          It's the thrill of a lifetime. And
          a long manuscript like the russians
          used to write and it's called BRIM!

     dakota
          No! Wait, I can't - I don't
          understand - you must tell me - I
          do want the job so - I was starving
          - but I can't -

inky has been looking at her, puzzled because she hasn't
caught his frantic excitement. He suddenly sees what is
troubling her. He calms down and goes back and sits.

     inky
          Oh, I see. You got me wrong. Nix,
          dakota, nix. This is strictly
          business. I'm no chaser. not that i 
          wouldn't but chasing i have learned
          is an awful adventure fraught with peril.

     dakota
              (meekly)
          I only wanted to -

     inky
          Sure. Sure you did. I got excited
          and forgot you didn't understand
          normal life. Listen, I'm inky the writer. Ever
          hear of me?

     dakota
          Ye-es. Yes. You make moving
          pictures. International and music too.

     inky
          That's right. And I've picked you
          for the lead in my next picture. We
          start tomorrow.

     dakota
          Where to?

     inky 
          A long way from here. Think, dakota, 
          long paragraphs, poetry, there might
          even be a chance for you to say moreover, 
          police and meat and  water corruption-
          high stakes politics and espionage now
          isn't that better than tramping in New
          York trying to keep out of the
          gutter.

     dakota
              (almost whispers)
          Oh, yes.

     inky
          I'm square, dakota. And I'll be square
          with you. No funny business. not that 
         there won't be some comedy but if you
         know me you know i keep away from trouble
         and trouble keeps away from me. 

     dakota
          What do I have to go?

     inky
              (leaning over her chair
and looking straight at
her)
          Nothing you don't want to - Trust me. And keep your chin up.

dakota looks at him for a moment, then he holds out his hand.

She takes it and they shake.  FADE WITH RISING MUSIC - 


(section yet to be transferred from archive - a few minutes
of screen time where the leading lady is presented) cut to:

	
	
	FADE IN - cover of giant book at dawn, getting under way. words busy
casting off lines,  editing stuff on draft. A typewriter is pounding
alongside. Demon on the binding head side stitching.

MEDIUM SHOT - dakota in white dress, wearing a heavy faux loose
fur pink coat inky has bought her. She climbs to binding head,
watching this strange new world.

Demon backs into scene without seeing her. He is shouting
at the twelve dwarves lines, that section has been cut from
the final draft.

Words enter and exit focus without consequence in a surreal
juxtaposition collage frenzy.

    Demon
         Carry that line like a motif! self propelled cadaver carrier, you
         hack! Back there and again! I told inky we could do without
         a soundtrack and spend the money on skilled typists.

He swings his arm round behind him in a violent full-armed
gesture and hits Dakota in the face. She staggers back against
the rail and nearly falls.

    Demon
             (turning)
         Who the fuck – What the hell are you doing up
         here?

    Dakota
             (meekly, hand to her face)
         I only wanted to see!

    Demon
             (gruffly)
         Well, I’m sorry. You’re the girl
         inky found at the last minute,
         aren’t you?

    dakota
         Yes. I’m - I’m awfully excited.
         It’s all so strange, and I’ve never
         been on a manuscript before.

    Demon
         And I’ve never worked with
         a woman before.

    dakota
         I guess you don’t think much of
         women, do you?

    Demon
         No. not the lot of them. They’re a cock-eyed nuisance.

    dakota
         I’ll try not to be.

    Demon
         You got in the way already. Better
         stay down at the typewriter by the keys.

    dakota
         What! The whole way!
             (she smiles at him)

    Demon
             (hesitates, then says in a
softened tone -)
         Say, I didn’t apologize very good
         for hitting you. That was an awful
         sock in the jaw.

Demon stares at her doubtfully, she looks up and meets
his gaze. Their eyes hold for a moment, then a short ringing bell
from alongside sounds, answered by one blast of return key swinging.

    Demon
         Well, we’re off.

    Dakota
             (clasping her hands and
peering into the mist)
         We’re off.

DISSOLVE TO - Long shot - Manuscript page - the vx diagram

DISSOLVE TO - The two first versions of the book already typed. A calm tropical
afternoon. Dakota and Bingbing, the Chinese cook, at the kitchen.
bingbing with enormous tub of octopusses, peeling them. Dakota
making  intricate notes with a bit of pencil’s end, fooling
with it as she talks.

    Dakota
         bingbing, how many octopuss do you
         suppose you’ve peeled since we left
         New York six weeks ago?

    BINGBING
         Too many.

    Dakota
         writers eat an awful lot, don’t
         they?

    Bingbing
         All time eat. No can fill up. Some
         day me go back to China, never see
         no more octopuss.

dakota finishes the note and shuts the diary.

    Dakota
         There. That’s fourteen quotes I’ve
         learned from brim.

    Bingbing
         Pretty soon now you be same as inky.
         Only don’t eat so much.

    Dakota
             (laughs, then looks around
with a contented sigh)
         I’d like to be a writer. Isn’t the
         story wonderful!

    BINGBING
             (drily)
         Oh yes, very pretty. very sad and true too much true like
         my taxes.

    Dakota
         Of course it wasn’t so nice up
         north when they tried to run him over,
         it was cold and rough.

    BINGbING
         Writing very fine line when you order
         truth -  how you like all same like
         eggs and beer for breakfast.

Demon strolls in. bingbing gets up and moves away.

    Demon
         Hello, Dakota. I’m caught up now on several of your plays.

    Dakota
         Hello, Demon. well, that’s a nice surprise. i didn’t think you
         cared. what did you think, do you want to slap my face again?

    Demon
         Well that was happenstance, no but i will say that most of the
         audience won’t know how hard you work and maybe you could
         be more reckless you know not so perfect and then you’d be
        worshipped like the goddess you want to be but where have you
        been all morning?

    Dakota
         Trying on costumes and quotes for Mr. inky.
         He’s going to make some tests of me this afternoon,
         here on the press conference section, when
         the light’s right.

    Demon
         Tests? Why?

    Dakota
         Oh - to see which side of my face
         looks best - and all that so he doesn’t get
         me confused with emma or whoever when he
         masturbates.

    DEmon
             (very gruff)
         Both sides looks all right to me, inky’s a fool but
         he means well i just don’t think it will help not
         with the coffee and the drugs.

    Dakota
             (laughs)
         Yes, but you’re not the movie
         director. you are only a demon!
          writers are known for masturbation.

    DEmon
         If I was the director, you wouldn’t be here.  not by a long shot.

    Dakota
         Well, that’s a nice thing to say after calling me perfect.

    Demon
         It’s no place for a girl. I worked with mailer and a few other writers
         and books are meant to be wroted by men real men besides he could
        have got someone that wouldn’t be no trouble in terms of box office
         for crying out loud if it wasn’t for him you’d be -

    Dakota
             (indignantly)
         I wish you wouldn’t keep harping on like
         that. It’s very mean of you. I’m human on the inside!
         Anybody hearing you’d think I’d been a lot of trouble.

demon grunts.

    Dakota
             (very cross)
         I haven’t! You can’t say I’ve been
         one bit of trouble to anyone on any set!
         I will have you know they’ve thrown me parties
         and sometimes i even get to keep the props!

demon is silent.

    Dakota
             (looks at him, waits, then
anxiously)
         Well, what have you got to say now?

    DEmon
         Sure you have, why do you think inky banned
         all the love seats and sofas? I told him it would
          be uncomfortable but he was like no it’s dakota
           well like a said the poor fool.

dakota
         I don’t see - Well, how do you mean?

    DEMON
         Look the fact of  your being here’s  trouble not to mention the insurance.

  DAKOTA
             (mournfully)
         Oh heavens. I thought everything was
         going to nicely.

DEmon looks at her downcast expression, wiggles
uncomfortably and at last blurts an attempt at consolation.

    Demon
         Aw, you’re swell and he’s head over heels about you. Women can’t help
         being a bother. I guess they’re made that way. can’t see an apple or go
         shopping without some sort of weirdness around it.

Oddly enough, this doesn’t cheer her up very much. But she
draws a long breath and smiles.

 DAKOTA
         Well, anyhow, I’ve had the happiest
         time of my life on this new maniscript.

Demon is a little touched by this. He gives her a quick
look and says awkwardly -

    DEmon
         Why - that’s fine really dandy.

A little pause. Demon thinks it over.

    DEmon
         Do you really mean that, dakota?

    Dakota
         Of course. Everyone’s so nice to me
         - Mr. inky and the countess -
         Don’t you think the countess is a
         sweet old lamb?

    Demon
             (grinning)
         I’d hate to have her hear me say
         so.

Dakota laughs and picks up shimmer, the cat, who cuddles down
in her lap contentedly.

    Dakota
         shimmer is nice to me too. He likes
         me better than he does anyone else
         in the book, don’t you shimmer?

Inky approaches them.

    INKY
         Beauty and the Beast.

    DEMON
         Well, I never thought I was
         handsome, but -
             (they all laugh)

    INKY
         Go put on a bra, Dakota. Light’s
         good for those tests now.

    Dakota
         I won’t be a minute, Mr. Inky.

She puts down shimmer and goes. inky scratches shimmer’s
head, watches him for moment.

    Inky
             (half aloud)
         Beauty and the Beast.

    DEMON
         Mr. INKY, I’ve going to do some
         butting-in.

    INKY
         What’s your worry, Demon?

    DEMON
         When do we find out where we’re
         going?

    INKY
             (smiling)
         Pretty soon now.

    DEMON
         Are you going to tell us what
         happens when we get there?

    INKY
         How can I? I’m no fortune-teller.

    DEMON
         But hang it all, you must have some
         idea what you’re after.

    INKY
         Going soft on me, demon?

    Demon
         You know I’m not, not by a long shot. But
         Dakota –

    INKY
         Oh you’ve gone soft on her? I’ve
         got enough on my hands without a
         love affair to complicate things.
         Better cut it out, Demon, the dame’s
         like my own flesh and blood.

    DEmon
             (sullenly)
         Love affair! You think I’m going to
         fall for any old nipples?

    INKY
             (musing)
         It never fails. Some big hard
         boiled egg goes goofy over a pretty
         face, and bingo! He cracks up and
         gets scrambled.

    DEmon
             (angry)
         Who’s getting scrambled? I haven’t run
         any cracks on you, have I?

    inkt
         Nope. You’re a good tough guy,
         demon. But if beauty gets you –
             (he stops, then laughs a
little)
         Why, I’m going right into a theme
         song!

   DEMON
             (sulky)
         What are you talking about?

   INKY
         It’s the idea for my picture. The
         Beast was a tough guy, demon. He
         could lick the world. But when he
         saw Beauty, she got him. He went
         soft, he forgot his wisdom, and the
         little fellers licked him. Think it
         over, demon it’s always the same story.

    Hack
             (coming up)
         Mr. inky, the countess says will
         you please come up on the korean section?
         We’ve reached the position you
         marked, she says.

    INKY
         Come on, demon. You’re in on this.
         I’m going to spill it.

DISSOLVE TO  table. Countess leaning over ; inky and
Demon across each other.

    COUntess
             (pointing with make-up brush)
         Here’s your first affair position.  South Korea - - -

FADE IN a composite  shot over the Malaysian docks -
Kuala Lupur Skyline dimly seen in background. Rain. Sounds of
traffic moving. DISSOLVE TO -

A group of police slopes up out of picture.

White, a rogue agent, comes along, peering at
a newspaper. He is forty, heavy, slow, but with a sharp eye. He
turns up his collar and shivers, stops and looks at the cops
doubtfully.

An old cop comes along from opposite side,
swinging a flashlight.


     White
          Hey, Is this the moving picture show?

     Azirul
          The Brim? Yep.
          You got any new orders?

     White
              (beat)
          Well orders are orders even the old ones are new?

     Azirul
          I dunno know, but I hear everybody
          talkin' about this writer feller
          that's running it.

     White
          inky, no. all you got to do is play dumb when the time comes?

     Azirul
          Guess that's the name. They say he
          ain't scare of nothin' - if he
          wants a picture of a lion he walks
          right up and tells it to look
          pleasant.

     White
          He's a tough egg, all right. But
          why the talk about this movie
          being crazy?

     Azirul
          Well, there's talk around the station
          about the target for one thing. And
          I never see any poison in the  KL
          plus the patsy being two girls.

     White
          Not enough men to handle them?

     Azirul
          Not enough! we got all the men
          those bitches could handle. We can
          even get Chinese men to sleep with
          them.

     Demon
              (from above)
          Hey, there! What do you want?

     White
          where's inky?

     Demon
              (comes down into picture)
          Yes. Who are you?

     White
          I want to see him. I'm White, from the mossad.

     Demon
          He was expecting the FSB but come on in. inky's getting wild.
          Hope you have some good news for him.
				     
				     DISSOLVE TO new chapter in moonlight - Dakota and nun chat.

     DAKOTA
          -- and an enormous lie, sister,
          all the way across that piece of
          land where we went to see.

     nun
          What fashion those girl do -- that
          girl with muslims on her?

     DAKOTA
          The poor thing, she looked -- as
          though she was too frightened to
          feel any fright. You know?

     NUN
              (nodding wisely)
          Sacrifice.

     DAKOTA
          The lawyer said she was the bride of
          Germany. Nun, what do you suppose
          INKY is?

     NUN
          My guess he look for very big word for this
          place. People here plenty scared.
          You don't worry. No can help.

shimmer gallops past.

     DAKOTA
          Oh, there's shimmer! He's got
          loose again.

nun grabs at him and misses. shimmer  goes down the deck.

     DAKOTA
          Catch him, sister. He'll get in
          the cabins and break things.

     NUN
          Me catch him. Bad devil, come here.

He goes off in pursuit. DAKOTA watches, laughing.

CUT TO hack on watch in typewriter. He looks round, yawns, sits
down and makes himself comfortable.

CUT TO dakota on manuscript. Demon enters.

     Demon
          Why aren't you in bed?

     DAKOTA
          I can't sleep. Those Malaysians make me
          nervous, I guess.

     DEMON
          I think inky's off his nut,
          taking you into that section today.

     DAKOTA
          I was -- sort of scared there for a
          while.

     Demon
          Huh! You weren't the only one.

     DAKOTA
          I wonder what we do next?

     DEMON
          That's what's worrying me. INKY's
          such a fool for risks. No telling
          what he'll ask you to do.

     DAKOTA
          After what he did for me, I'll do
          anything he wants.

     DEMON
          Don't talk like that. When it comes
          to getting a picture, he's crazy
          enough to try anything.

     DAKOTA
          I won't go back on him.

     DEMON
          When I think what might have
          happened today -- if anything
          happened to you.

     DAKOTA
              (laughing)
          Why then you wouldn't be bothered
          with a woman on board.

     DEMON
              (very staccato)
          Don't laugh. I'm scared for you.
          I'm sort of - I'm scared of you,
          too. DAKOTA, I -- I guess I love you.

They look at each other, both startled by this conclusion.

     DAKOTA
          DEMON! You hate women!

     DEMON
              (still surprised over his
discovery)
          You aren't -- women. I love you.
          DAKOTA, I don't suppose -- you don't
          feel like that about me -- do you?

DAKOTA looks at him soberly for a moment, then takes a step
nearer.

Just as his arms go around her, a hail from the typing.

     COUNTESS'S VOICE
          Mr. DEMON! Are you on deck?

     DEMON
              (lifts his head long
enough to reply)
          Yes, sir.
              (then bends over DAKOTA
again)

     COUNTESS'S VOICE
          Please come up here a minute.

     DEMON
              (same business)
          Yes, sir.

     DAKOTA
          I'll wait here for you.

DEMON kisses her once more and goes reluctantly.

DAKOTA leans back against the page with a happy devilish smile,
looking after him.

The Witch Doctor rises noiselessly behind her, and without a
sound she is seized and lifted over the screen.

THE Next page. NIGHT. COUNTESS, INKY, DEMON - talking
over the manuscript now more frantic.

     INKY
          Now tomorrow morning, pick out the
          hacks to go ashore. Couple of those
          nervous hacks you better leave
          aboard.

     COUNTESS
          Mr. INKY wants you to break out
          the cole younger goods the first thing
          tomorrow.

     INKY
          We'll try a little bartering, bribery, hell anything.

     DEMON
          Still hoping to make lobsters with
          that wild bunch?

     INKY
          Sure. We've got to. I've got to
          find out what the smokescreen is.

     COUNTESS
              (impatiently)
          It's the tribal reptilian vampire legend, their
          mind control, of course.

     DEMON
          You planning to make movies of a
          fairy tale story?

     INKY
          How do you know vampire's only a
          legend or a fairy story? That facade
          wasn't built for fun.

     DEMON
          But you said yourself it was constructed
          so long ago the people who live
          here now might not know anything about
          it.

     INKY
          Yes, but they've kept it in damn
          good repair like a lot of religions. 
         Did you see how those
          guns were fastened? They're meant
          to keep something out.

COUNTESS and Demon exchange skeptical looks.

Noise of soundtrack increase suddenly.

     COUNTESS
              (looks at watch)
          After ten. And the camp is still lit.

     INKY
          If I could only take pictures by
          moon light! I'd sneak back there now
          and get a scene.

     COUNTESS
              (exasperated)
          Be sensible. We're lucky to be all
          safe in the book tonight.

     INKY
          Oh sure, sure.

He looks to DEMON, who has crossed over and is peering
down onto the typewriter.

     INKY
          What is it, demon?

     DEMON
          Oh -- er -- I was looking for DAKOTA.
          She's gone down into the keys i guess.

     INKY
          How about turning in, Countess?

     COUNTESS
          No, not really for me tonight.

     INKY
          But you've set a hack in the watch tower.

COUNTESS shakes her head stubbornly. Demon starts to go.

     INKY
          Oh well, I'll sit up with you then.

     COUNTESS
          Mr. DEMON, I wish you'd take a
          star and beam back to your master
          to See how our position
          checks out with what I got last
          night before we ran into the eyes wide 
          shut court house.

DEMON gets out the horn instruments.

     DEMON
              (reluctantly)
          Yes countess. I guess it's been a long
          time since the master got a
          new message to decipher.

DISSOLVE TO NUN, on afterdeck, tying shimmer and scolding
it in Chinese. shimmer meowing and scolding right back at
her. SHOT of hack watch, having a peaceful nap.

DISSOLVE TO new chapter, interior - Countess and DEMON
bending over chart, making calculations. INKY half asleep
in a chair.

     COUNTESS
          That's about it.
              (marking manuscript)
          We'll make absolutely sure early tomorrow
          .

inky yawns, stretches, looks at watch, crosses and looks
toward the next page as it fills out suddenly but slower
this time round so that a wait is required before reading....

     INKY
          Ah midnight. Hey, look at that. I can almost remember
          when i wrote that one, i wish i hadn't wroted so much though.

     COUNTESS
              (crosses and looks)
          Howling going through near the court house it sounds like.

DEMON exits.

     INKY
          Looks like the night before they held
          election.

Music rises and increases suddenly.

     INKY
          Listen to 'em howl, will you? Wonder
          what's up.

CUT TO main manuscript. DEMON speaking to NUN.

     NUN
          Me don't know, sir. Me not see
          Miss Dakota one, two hour.

     DEMON
          Guess, she's gone to inky's spa room.

He goes off. nun takes a long round praying, sees something
near edge of page. words are falling back into the typewriter
she Goes over, picks them up. A chinese word is
woven in with the others. sHe examines it for a moment, 
suddenly realizes there are also russian words and what
that means, jumps and shouts.

     NUN
          THERE"S NO FRIGATE LIKE BOOK! THE FRIGATE!!!

she stamps frantically on deck, turns and runs for the
typewriter.

hack on watch in keys runs to page heading and
shouts.

     HACK ON HEAD
          All hands on deck!

CUT TO bridge. NUN runs into COUNTESS and inky.

     NUN
          Look sir! Me  found  russian chinese on deck.

     COUNTESs
          foreign words maybe even attempted translation!

     nun
          Crazy black man that place comes
          this place!

DEMON arrives on the run.

     DEMON
          Who's turning the workks upside down? What's
          the matter?

     COUNTESS
          the nun found this. Some one's been
          toying with the type. Search the book.

NUN exits.

     DEMON
          Oh my dear! Where's DAKOTA?

     INKY
          In her trailer -

     DEMON
          No, she isn't! I looked.

He rushes out. Confused sound of hack' voices from typewriter
below. COUNTESS leans from the escape from frame side, shouts down.

     COUNTESS
          SLAVE!

     SLAVE'S VOICE
              (from below)
          Yes highness.

     COUNTESS
          Man and beast.  Get them all. Serve out the
          arms. Search the entire manuscript!

     SLAVE'S VOICE
          Yes your highness. -he starts grunting for the minions to gather-

Slave's grunt is heard, creak and thump of minions.
COUNTESS takes her blood vial from several chapters back,
examines it, puts it in her pocket.

     INKY
          The dreams, COUNTESS? Do you think -- ?

     COUNTESS
              (significantly)
          They may have stolen something else.

They look at each other for a moment, as they start out.
      
      (other scene yet to be transferred from archives...)
      They look at each other for a moment, as they start out.

DISSOLVE TO exterior and headlines. The scenes in open in 
multiple screens where the manuscript, typewriter, et cetera
were. the procession offers a history of the case through, 
dakota is at the altar of cable network executives with
paparazzi crowding below.

CUT TO medium shot of meeting, altar on left. Dakota
being tied to altar. 

CUT TO timeline of the vietnam war next to hippie movement
 and 70s disco scenes. dakota turns into sperm and starts "evolving"
before our eyes until the eage of eight. Paparazzi bulbs like candles
flickering and  torches burning.

Two men begin in suits with signs that read "no women directors in
hollywood", those behind them yelling "hallmark seasonal movies" 
"lifetime bio pics" and "showtime soft porn".

CUT TO close up, ghosts of ancient starlets only certain film buffs
would recognize - some of them with a striking similarity in looks
to dakota.

Top of altar. network executive invoking BRIM:

     NE
          We call thee, BRIM. O Mighty One,
           The bride is here, O Mighty
          writing, Great BRIM have mercy on us
           and let us continue our plunder and pillage
             of your one idea and we we will let you 
           take the bride when you masturbate.

CUT TO los angeles and casting director. soundtrack 
suddenly stops. a bootleg copy of BRIM is handed to her, she  looks at
the audition actresses against the  wall, beats her chest and cries how
could he pick that dakota! it's not even the johnson one and look at all 
the fine bitches willing to murder for even a bit part! 

CUT TO exterior with paparazzi, meeting at altar. network executive
walks into camera view and raises his arms.

everyone watches in silence.

CUT TO nearer, dakota and altar with a something crawling in the 
background, cutting to double projection when three finger reptilian vampire passes
foreground looking very much like a human otherwise .

moon landing in close up stands nothing visible, sounds intercut static. what was that/
there's something back there / they are watching us/ screen fades to black static remains

CUT TO straight shot of people building a starbucks in front of aushwitz birkinau two poland
next to screen cctv tape on the doan thi huong / siti aisyah incident.

CUT TO war on drugs, DEA agents burning money in a lavish vegas party with strippers
and drink sets,  ads for various types of medication flash alongside along with side effects
indications, two doctors in a fist fight over cholesterol levels and two nurses in a wrestling
match over blood pressure....BRIM's party racing through the turning pages of the manuscript
in yet another screen and straight  into the altar.

CUT TO exterior altar set, reptilian alien turns from Altar with Dakota in
his hostage vehicle, a rust lined blue pickup truck you might see in rural farm areas
 and drives toward camera. Paparazzi near altar in uproar
one of them drops a camera, flashbulbs, they are yelling, waving recording
cell phones as well.

CUT TO DEMON and party reaching the proceedings, he hears DAKOTA
scream, looks through.

CUT TO what he sees. Edge of altar, the pick up truck going into the distant horizon.

ALIEN drives away from camera and into a dusty road, does not turn to look
back,  Dakota is barely seen in the passenger seat.

CUT TO ALTAR. DEMON wildly gesturing to slave, minions, and hacks to
overrun the network executives and reach DAKOTA. soundtrack rises.

hacks struggle with box office receipts and popularity polls. They finally get through with
 the dues ex machina appearance of emma thompson  who gives the english where's the
tea look one eyebrow partly raised and the gang slips through.

LAP DISSOLVE



EXT. SHIP EDGE - FULL SHOT - DAY

DISSOLVE IN as ALIEN climbs to a ledge at  which he
places dakota near the  opening of the ship.
He is unaware that the bonano clan is following him. He enters the
ship and returns momentarily to get the girl.



INT. SHIP - GENERAL VIEW - DAY

A great set of lights flicker at camera right. Entrance as at
back. They are christmas lights as one might find in a teenager's
room circa 2012 at an outlet through the floor through there's
a two seat cockpit  with a waterfall effect within a viewfinder.
. A trail leads up camera left to other side of inner ship
it  looks out upon an opening
through which thunder and lightning pours and returns
It is daylight below the effect but evening above which
faintly illuminates like stars while the subterranean depths below
hint at other corridors perhaps solitary rooms for captives. ALIEN
enters with DAKOTA, passes along the camera left side of
the ship towards the controls.

The lead of the mobster rears into the scene He stares at
alien, who can be seen up the tying dakota into a container
 in capsule shape which floats a bit after he is done. 
The mobster lunges for the alien
and starts in with frantic frenzy against the alien.

Demon enters in the background and at once sneaks behind them
and goes for the cell phone trick again.

Alien gasps as the echo returns and scans the lair while fighting
iff the furious bonano. He pulls down the man  with a
roar, to attack the DEMON. DAKOTA  with same effect of
daylight below and night overhead shot, in the capsule.

Instantly, the rest of the mafia bring themselves in to finish the ALIEN and
he for an instant grins and sneers at them while poking his finger into the
first one's skull producing the dislodged eyeball which he flings at the group.

ALIEN fights to keep himself from being overtaken
the mob and the echo , which the demon has  reproduced. 
He grips at the group with his arms and hands, locks his
leg about one that stumbled crushing his neck, then sinking his
teeth into the nearest one to his face. The mobsters in turn start 
shooting at the alien trying to wound him. After a few moments
they realize the bullets go right through him and melt on the ground
as if his composition were bullet proof, accompanied by hideous noises, both
sides give low grunts and hisses as each exerts strength against the other.

It is a question of which will be crushed first. there are now several of them on
top of the alien when slightly startled by a knife wound after the shooting and DEMON  in
the foreground or background of this shot. As the mobsters locked in a death embrace, 
grow still, hardly moving at all as if pressing for the last,
FADE OUT.

FADE IN. BACK AT THE STARTING POINT - NIGHT - HACKS on guard.
COIUNTESS, BINGBING and others in group round INKY who is
sitting on the ground, torn, dishevelled, still panting.

     INKY
          --COUNTESS, I tell you this ALIEN is
          the craziest thing on earth.
          He shook the men off that rave like
          flies.

     COUNTEss
          All those men lost! Incredible!

     INKT
          DEMON said he'd try to signal us
          when he found DAKOTA.

     COUNTESS
              (groans)
          We'll never see either of them
          again.

     BINGBING
          Don't give it up, COUNTESS. There's
          still a chance for DEMON

     INKY
          We'll have to wait for daylight.
          Then we'll bridge the rave.
          Where's that other case of lasers?

     Slave
          Here, sir.

     COUNTESS
          This--this ALIEN that you saw,
          will he care for lasers?


     INKY
          If we can get near enough to use
          'em, you bet he'll care. I downed the
          ship at least for a while well Have you had any
          trouble?

    COUNTESS
          Yes, just after you left.

     INKY
          What happened?

     COUNTESS
          We fired a couple of lasers over
          some italians, and they took to the
          trail like scared rabbits.

     INKY
          BONANO's something new for them to 
          get A-listers on sitcoms but they are actually
           helping to fight the alien, sort of sweet that
           you didn't aim for the kill - huh?

     COUNTESS
          NOW i've heard it all. 

     2ND SLAVE
          nobody else near our cover ever
          since.

     INKY
              (to 2nd slave)
          slave, get up on the rise and keep
          your eyes peeled. We'll start at
          dawn, whether we get a signal from
          DEMON or not.

          to stand still and fuck him with a laser.

The Reporters turn to INKY, saying "Oh, you're the hero."
"Come on spill it," etc.

          story and the only story - If it hadn't been for her,
          we'd never have got near the ALIEN. He
          came back for her.

     3RD REPORTER
          Beauty and the Beast, huh?

     INKY
          That's it. Play up that angle.
          Beauty and the Beast. ALIEN could
          have stayed safe where we'd never
          have got him, but he couldn't stay
          away from Beauty. That's your
          story, boys.

     2ND REPORTER
          It's a story all right.

     1ST PHOTOGRAPHER
          How about a few pictures?

     INKY
          Wait. I want you to take it with
          good lights on the stage in front
          of the audience. We'll ring the
          curtain up now, and I'll make a
          speech. Tell 'em about the ALIEN and
          Miss FANNING and MR DEMON and EVEN
          Miss BINGBING. Then when
          I call you, you all come on and
          take pictures.

The photographers ad lib. "Sure," "We'll do that," etc.

     INKY
          Come on DAKOTA. I want you and the DEMON
          there when the curtain goes up.

     DAKOTA
              (shrinking)
          Oh, no. I couldn't -
 
      INKY
          It's all right. We've knocked some
          of the fight out of him since you
          saw him previously.

He urges DAKOTA off. DEMON follows.

Cut to back of theatre, looking toward stage, curtain down.

House packed. INKY comes before the curtain. In almost the
tones of the circus ringleader, he begins:

     INKY
          Ladies and gentlemen, I am here
          tonight to tell you a strange
          story. So strange a story that no
          one will believe it. But, ladies
          and gentlemen, seeing is believing,
          and we -- I and my partners -- have
          brought back the living proof of
          our adventure, an adventure in
          which most of our party met
          terrible death but then so did the
          threat of nuclear waste materials -

Cut to wings of theatre. Reporters and photographers looking
onto the stage.

     2ND PHOTOGRAPHER
          Holy smoke, looks like VALENTINO!

     1ST PHOTOGRAPHER
          Hope he's well SEDATED yeah  good and plenty.

     1ST REPORTER
          Sure he is. INKy's taking no
          chances. remember he wrote
          the scene where anderson cooper
          bangs ronan farrow - still can't believe
          a gay sex tape did so swell!

Cut to front of theatre. INKY addressing audience -
  
          INKY

          - and now, ladies and gentlemen,
          before I tell you more, I am going
          to show you the greatest sight your
          eyes ever beheld. this was the ship
          and the portal into our world which
          was used to satisfy the alien's appetite,
          but now he comes to town,
          merely a captive, a show to gratify
          your curiosity. Ladies and
          gentlemen, behold the ALIEN, the reptile
          Wonder of the universe.

The curtain rises to disclose a raised platform, on which is
the ship and the ALIEN, loaded with chains and so fastened 
that movement would not be possible. Murmurs and exclamations from the
audience, a few rise to their feet to get a better look.

CUT TO medium shot on stage. INKY takes DAKOTA's lovely hand.

     INKY
          I want to introduce Miss DAKOTA
          FANNING. The luckiest girl I've
          ever known.

Audience applauds.

     INKY
          There the Beast, and here the
          Beauty. She has lived through an
          experience that no other woman ever
          dreamed of. And she was rescued
          from the very grasp of ALIEN by her
          future husband. I want you to meet
          a very brave gentleman, Mr. JUX
          DEMON.

Audience applauds. DEMON bows awkwardly.

     INKY
          Now, before I tell you the full
          story of our voyage. I am going to
          ask the gentlemen of the press to
          come forward, so that the audience
          may have the privilege of seeing
          them take the first photographs of
          ALIEN and his captors.

He looks off-stage and beckons. MILItary and INtelligence agents
 let the press through - The press men come on.

     INKY
          Miss FANNING first, alone. Stand in
          front of the ALIEN, DAKOTA.

DAKOTA reluctantly does so.

     1ST PHOTOGRAPHER
          That's it - That's near enough. TURN THIS WAY

     2ND PHOTOGRAPHER
          Ready. Hold it. Smile, please.  LET'S SEE THE BACK NOW

The cameras go off. ALIEN roars. Df looks round in
terror, with a raised brow.

     INKY
          Don't be alarmed, ladies and
          gentlemen. Those chains are made of pure
          california american made chrome steel. He can't move.
          It's already even written in BRIM! Copies at the concession
          stand, mind you.

cameras flashing again. ALIEN roars and strains at chains. DAKOTA
covers her face. Demon steps forward to her.

     DEMON
          It's all right, DAKOTA -

    INKY
          Get them together, boys. They're
          going to be married tomorrow.

     1ST PHOTOGRAPHER
          Put your arm around her, DEMON.

DEMON does so. Flashing cameras. ALIEN roars, struggles. DAKOTA
hides her face against DEMON.

     INKY
          Wait. Hold on. He thinks you're
          attacking the girl.

     1ST PHOTOGRAPHER
          Let him roar. Swell picture. Hey you two bit VALENTINO
           how about keeping your chin up!
              (to other camera men)
          Get this shot for LONDON

CAMERA flash again.

With a frightful shriek, ALIEN breaks his chains and lightning bolts strike.

Demon and DAKOTA through door.

ALIEN starts across arena.

They run.

ALIEN pushes down big door. Crowded street seen beyond him.

He leaps through.

ALIEN comes up to hotel. Door is jammed - He peers
through a window.

DEMON and DAKOTA in elevator going up. She is clinging to
him in panic.

ALIEN outside hotel.

A woman, several stories above, looks out window, sees ALIEN,
screams. ALIEN looks up, sees elle fanning, thinks it is DAKOTA, starts
to climb slips and slides then lightning strikes making the surface crack
and he starts up again against the breaks. ELLE sees him coming,
 goes back from window.

ALIEN climbing up building.

A room in hotel, five men playing poker.

     1ST MAN
          Sweeten it - sweeten it. 

They all ante, while 2nd Man deals.

     3RD MAN
          What's all the doings over there at
          the theatre?

     2ND MAN
          Sounds like a three-alarm fire.

     4TH MAN
          Aw, some movie stunt about an
          alien.
       .

     5TH MAN
          I hear the theatre's sold out.

     3RD MAN
          This town sure is full of dumb ass losers.

     1ST MAN
          i don't know how that inky is going to top this one!

ALIEN appears at window. They panic.

Another room in hotel. DAKOTA and DEMON rush in, he slams
door. DAKOTA clings to him for a moment, then collapses on bed,
gasping and sobbing. He kneels beside her.

     DEMON
          Hush, DAKOTA. Hush, darling. It's all
          right. You're safe here.

ALIEN climbing building.

Another hotel room. A woman in negligee at telephone.

     WOMAN
          Yes, Julio, it's Jennifer- I been
          waiting for you to call up.

     JULIO

          yelling -- JENNY! JENNY! Operator,
          something's happened!

ALIEN at window. He reaches in, slides her out,  pulls her out
window.

Exterior, hotel wall. ALIEN looks at her, sees he feels nothing for her,
drops her disgustedly.

Demon's hotel room. DAKOTA sitting on bed. DEMON kneeling
beside her.

     DEMON
          We'll stay here, dear. I won't
          leave you. They'll get him. It's
          all right.

     DAKOTA
              (gasping)
          It's a like a horrible dream. It's
          like -- being back there -- on the
          bad parts of brim.

Demon puts his arms round her, murmurs soothingly.

ALIEN appears in window.

DEMON starts up. DAKOTA turns and sees, shrieks, cowers on
bed.

ALIEN smashes window, his hand comes in, reaching. DEMON
picks up a chair and attacks hand.

ALIEN'S hand knocks him and chair across room, where he lies senseless.

rushes out.

Hotel corridor. inky running toward camera, followed by
pop eyed cigarette girls, hookers and fandom.

Door to Demon's room opens, and Demon staggers out,
almost colliding with inky.

     INKY
          DEMON! He's climbing up, outside
          there.

     DEMON

They rush off.

CUT TO roof of hotel. INKY and DEMON run in. They see
ALIEN, holding DAKOTA, going over another roof. He goes out of
sight.

     INKY
          What'll we do?

     1ST FIREMAN
          He may have fallen.

Searchlight settles on ALIEN on a distant roof.

     1ST FIREMAN
          There! There he is.

     2ND FIREMAN

          ago.

Crowd in street. Two men looking up.

     1ST MAN

     2ND MAN
          Well, what could he hide in?

     1ST MAN
          Gee, I hope he don't come down in
          the street.

     2ND MAN

Police Station. cop at desk with phone. inky and
Demon pacing the floor. Phone rings.

     cop
              (into phone)
          Yes? Yes...No, not
          yet...Headquarters is broadcasting
          the reports.
              (he hangs up)

     THE LOUDSPEAKER
          ALIEN , the reptile wonder, is still at
          large. He has not been seen since
          midnight. The whole city is
          aroused. We are hoping for a report
          at any moment. avocados will be available
           after the morning rush hour.

DEMON sits down with a groan and puts his head in his
hands. INKY rests a hand on his shoulder.

     INKY
          Snap out of it, DEMON. They're bound
          to find him when morning comes.

     DEMON
          I can't do anything. DAKOTA's out
          there -- somewhere --

     INKY
          But we're pretty sure he won't hurt
          her.

     DEMON
          He may have dropped her. She may be
          lying somewhere hurt.

     THE LOUDSPEAKER
          Attention, all stations! ALIEN has
          been seen again. He is in the ship
          off the warehouses at 41st Street.
          He is going toward the East River.
          He is still carrying DAKOTA FANNING.

DEMON leaps up, clutching INKY.

Phone on desk rings.

     COP
              (answering it)
          Yes?...Yes, the report just come
          in...I don't know. What can we do
          without killing the girl, too?

     INKY
          If he puts DAKOTA down --

     SERGEANT
              (into phone)
          It'll be daylight in an hour. Keep
          him in sight.

     THE LOUDSPEAKER
          ALIEN is going West. He is making
          for the Empire State Building.

     DEMON
              (to cop)
          If he goes up there, what can we
          do? It may be for the portal even if
         that ship is on its last legs -

     COP
          We won't be able to get near him.

     THE LOUDSPEAKER
          ALIEN is hovering the Empire State.
          He is still carrying her.

     INKY
          That's does it, call that friend of ours in brooklyn.

     DEMON
          They couldn't handle him the first time around!
          But there is  one thing we could try?

     COP
          What?

     DEMON

          HELICOPTERS. he can't go anywhere in that
          thing we removed the carburator now when he 
        notices he'll have to abondon it and should he any 
          space between himself and  DAKOTA  --  they could fly near
          enough to pick  him off -- without
          hitting her --

     COP
          You're right! choppers -- as soon as
          it's daylight --
              (he turns to phone and
starts to call)

     AGENT
          They'll get him.

     DEMON
          Have they even done anything like this before?
              (he starts inside)

     AGENT
          Hold on. Don't you get on that roof
          too.

     INKY

wounds. Looks at DAKOTA, reaches as though to protect her.

Top of Empire State. More CHOPPERS zoom down. ALIEN stands
erect, pulling away bullets now lodged against bullets that failed to go through
and melt he throws them aside none of these melted - choppers sweep by, firing.
He staggers, turns slowly watching another bolt take down a second chopper
but the bullets now congest and he is seriously wounded, and topples off roof
nearly after the second falling helicopter --

EXT. DOME OF THE EMPIRE STATE - DAWN

DAKOTA lying on ledge. Demon, inky, couple of agents rush
in, as alien goes over. DEMON leaps across, gets dakota,
he is incoherent with terror for her. He hugs her
wildly, talking all the time.

     DEMON
          DAKOTA! DAKOTA! Are you all right? Oh, my
          darling, sure you're not hurt?

     DAKOTA
          Ad lib.

INKY and one agent lean over the parapet looking down at the
fallen ALIEN then back at the ship.

     AGENT
              (drawing a long breath)
          Gee, what a sight. Well, the
          state department will want this junk pile
          now anyway those sharp shooters sure got him.

     INKY
          Oh no, it wasn't the sharp shooter
              (agent looks puzzled)
          It was Beauty killed the Beast.

Cop stares at him, very puzzled.

  FADE OUT.
