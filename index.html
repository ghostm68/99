ides of march and beyond...

i
	
Then bones wrapped me like wings,
same meal five times a day
I danced Alexandra.
She kissed someone else,
Asian girl, atop my stop,
hands hey and she tells me
making meaning, I thought it was
that type of party, awake to sequin
memory, Emilee pregnant,
Our bath in a belly
but I fear— History will
not forgive stories in the press
insisting: moscow dictator 
as we choose the same two choices
every election isnt it the same

in most places. 
except they dont have a man like
recognition putin, 
I suggest Woolf's Orlando
and find a Panzer tale in the 
process because marcus aurelius
lost me at love your fellow man.
 when I was at neighbor war,
fighting to record prelude 
in e minor opus 28 no.4
for jimmy page after 
that one ovationizing welk.
of course i 'hould 'ave
raved for charlotte
saved my life in a sense...

ii

d'alessio the one with
a behave arm, i get up
my own numb - perhaps from shopping
or cricket keira,
outside the store, story dream
natalie in a suit bright
seemingly off to a fashion show
it's pages not port - a man 
pass-anger seat she slides 
down his zipper from within
pants. wizardry. I awake -
Alexandra is going to exercise
for seven days - the chords,
arrived and i lean against 
persian notes.

g, c, am, d, e...i guess
key of c or g - already decided to
record it only with Guitar-
like a plot which organizes to present
an alternate history, 312
	    (all this time won't do)
title by emilee-
left me weary of multi-tracking...
Hollywood has been doing that,
i suppose some are intent on the Hoax
being kept but one glance tells anyone
November 1963 the powers that buzz and bee
hive history in blind honey pink Chanel
2103 none of us can wait that long -
no it don't matter but Dang it 'hould 'ave
always. subjective truth, no sense
in denying denials. work in song awaits.
the Fable is what remains -
let us pray it is not
	    the Lie we are being 
force-fed by sex media incorporated. 

iii
	    
intent missed soul, sole, seoul,
point is upon election
eve he could have bombed.
Any of their cities to the ground,
you 'ould 'ave, saying we are winning,
The worry War. Constellation
making me watch, for noomi, 
the alternate, or alternative realities
seductive, unlike the plain lie
as in once upon a time in Hollywood
which faces, contradictions...
concerned with nostalgia
call the new track zetsubo zafa
tattoo parlour for a friend in
canada, toronto perhaps montreal.

in the dream. 
i do not have awake three hours 
after exhaustion, 
and bizarre trip to pay bill
and market...Richard Freiherr von Rosen,
they are like wikipedia adding  w.h.e.
i get to sleep in frenzy confusion.
there is an electronic tree,
each leaf a screen

to continue these explorations
i am not happy to report
that the delay has yet to

two versions of the track

(lyric and chords for OSPEW)

verse/chorus
wisdom hand magic touch held dream

thin as fire our death still in a scream 

sometimes remembering by candle light

bell chimes like your sandal shuffle right

left the world our burning love

ocean sand prints the eternal wave

moon pours out sunrise’s yellow grave

other times deja vu kiss we feel

hell of now these moments we steal

theft the world elevation above

lennon singing nobody told me ther’d be days like these

walrus blind lust sold nothing prayer knees

sometimes in voodoo rock and roll we are free

heaven in ruins like notre dame or me

bereft the world without true love 

theft the world elevation above

left the world our burning love

wisdom hand magic touch held dream

thin as fire our death still in a scream 

sometimes remembering by candle light

bell chimes like your sandal shuffle right

left the world our burning love

left the world our burning love

how many years how many tears

 The recording, waveform 12
although "home" the track wasnt empty
my lament at the impossible first take.
goddess that is or was,
second take delivery sirena door,
i fiddled notes before third take
not as on, more ballad than intended.
four and five trying for time
arriving at six, but i don;t
sing the same without holding the axe -
the full story of that song...
well that is a novel, i might not get to write...
in any case, cover is praise 
vulcan's wife - because i owe Him a poem.
java jolted i noted
third earthquakes in new april york
i think i made friends with def and grace -

she lost pick, hella died. 
foreign correspondent, rose glascock -
no erection for films now, 
still at lucy in the sky with hale
yup pll season one, as bad as it gets -
the ppl of cali are lucky to have her...
had no idea about joshua tree until.
my point is you have an obvious star,
why make her work seven years 
on a soap operaesque triviality tease from which there
is no escape -
so anti-meritorious.
.
i like the word transnistria...
not sure about the place, pridnestrovian...
otherwise thinking about tits.
i ask myself if i really love emilee. 
why still the distraction...song i heard
today i only have eyes for tits, i mean you...


	    
 This is derailing, jokerman dance
trisapol city do you like my records?
perhaps it is distance, what am i standing here for?
ah yes dreams, but peek the broken handcuff tattoo
aurora anarchy has on her tits, 
i didnt mean to put down karli mergenthaler -
or to like melanie marie's breast...
not as on, dream pool woman with three tits.
like a strap across her chest - 
i was playing, lost my martin, asked
stood in a room where funny fat women moaned -
raising their hands until wet dream...
sweatpants i have not worn...
more concerned with my six string - 
bully men take no note - lock the door.
i wait then awake to find my acoustic still there.

alec baldwin got his patience stolen, again -

more recent scene, switzerland guitar. 
fifty frets, ten dollars -
i walk over to emilee, is this alright
she reaches red purse for money
but i explain that i am asking for her permission -
i got the bullets...
i get up feeling the fakes wanting her safety net.
i finalize the details of her portrait,
nearly done now upon my wall. 
there's talk from kinsky vienna klimt
thirty million but i cant translate
cover my two room windows with aluminum foil -
felt shot down and hobbled last walk.
.
i listen to tore down...
regret my tone is more freddie, than slwohand...
that is, when simply strumming here.
a bunch of new chord progressions. 
no new songs, i argue with her...but i love her more than tits.
i dream she writes me three notes, gives them to me...
i lay me down at the foot of the ash tree instead of reading
i am mesmerized by fluttering things of a tan disposition,
a spider web with two spiders and an army of perhaps ants
crawling away from the under bush - i think for a minute
it is from my elbow...it's all i can think about for some
time hoping she has returned to me...
meanwhile i think i made friends with eliott easton.
i get instagram but start looking for signs...
i delete the app knowing there is no way
i can digest all the content in context without
misplacing logic even if it accents loneliness.
i had not seen my satanic ritual art for odeya rush
in a while...hmm out of the blue the hint of maria
neverova but i have no idea why...i suspect the boundary
problem with some family members but why riot against
the unknown...best to fight nasal congestion instead...
play my scales,
sandwich and chips...
wait for emilee most likely in vain. 
i swear sometimes i think even keira is jealous.
surely i have said too much and i won't call you shirley again.

xiii
sunday was saying kfc and 
sunday was saying pizza
i look at leah and recall
emilee would commit a crime
for a plate of pasta...
cleaning up as little as possible
i fix the noodles and watch the show -
well i only listend to one 
episode while cleaning and
cooking then viewd the following
one ending in
lab mice cages..
.pages of skin in a bikini dream
i glide my hand under the latex 
which is surprisingly
flexible the girl has beauty
mark on her right and
as i feel down to a shaved 
wax center it occurs to me
that i was with someone else 
a minute go yet could
not recall the details...
she seems to smile but i
wake up nearly worried 
that i have not been  true
to my desire...perhaps it was staying
up late wondering over t
he daytona news about the man
at the holiday inn reportedly offd 
himself to avoid
a hit and run incident...
i suppose for the possible
meanings and obviously the fact 
that no one tells
when you rent a room
in most cases that something
like that happened...didn't go 
out but thought about
that other walk, 
the dream that day had been about
 someone upset making dogs pay for the anger...
several poor pups, 
some where slammed and others
where thrown out the window...
i myself threw a  few dollars at ocean
protocol, everytime i think 
to get golem i hear led zep 
the evil one, ramble on -
do i continue this path into season two...
i can't really decide 
- on the one hand the list
of films to watch is rising 
but it gives me something
to look ahead to and on the
other hand i had wanted
to see all the lucy hale in 
action...for titty
fans there is the horizontal dude,
but my favorite was a cinderella story
once upon a song...i wonder
if it was eiza competition...
looking at the date.
looking at the hour 
it doesn't feel alike midnight.
oklahoma had it awful last night 
i noticed while reading about cambodia...
munitions, my music oh
yeah that one was sort of cool
in a quirky way...
not the twenty dead,
but 'all i wanted'...
hopefully one day we can come 
up with something
to rival 'roll out the barrel'...
meanwhile please consider more safety 
on baltimore roads for people driving 
home after a ten hour work day...
i remember emilee and keira both spoke about
the anxiety - in their case before - i was 
more concerned later 
over the curtained econoline -
travel is necessary but truck 
stops and parking
lots aint good for much, 
in that sense my mind
was much eased given that
soon after the salon
shut down they were sort of together again - 
listening to macbeth, 
as i do once in a while,
screw your courage
to the sticking place and
we'll not fail, 
i had a vision of her aunt...
not sure what it meant
last week when i 
felt no hunger at hopelessness
- maybe the words to so you wanna
be a rock and roll star
are more than lyrics "a little insane"...
contrast cypress
"shits funny how impossible dreams
manifest"... hill,
long nights after peck
macarthur i kept seeing myself in fatigues
a reoccurring dream from which i rose not
knowing if we were conquering or had been
overwhelmed by the forces holding the hill.

the last pill i saw her take,
hinted at being in love
with her style.
so much so as to desire reincarnation,
before and after,
leaving my lust in . the Dust.
I suppose, what do i do with my love, 
the dream says nothing, or there is no bus
no seductive suv, two beat up pick up trucks
a motley crowd deformed and dreary
I am about to get onto, metallic bed...
imagining eternity on the wrong road
i sigh - 
lies what are they
if the mind is true
north. car ol in a char lotte.
shots fired so new i wish i knew no more.

sour reminder 'put everything you own
here on this seat' 
i really should be more bitter
yet can't help my carefee...joy
in the bliss of being me. well
when i can escape ape planet.
people posers, scape throat shouts
threatening tranquility et cetera..
 i shave, going on a bizarre diet
to shake the hovering ghost
of take a shit instead of ejaculating -
the yen slides unable to
keep track of the toilet times,
it's a long way to the top going down
the road feeling bad...ozzy confronted
by put Ja he's us in front you replies
we don't kill today...
god has a hard on for marines because we
kill everything we see...
lincoln county road or armaggedon?

xv

have i misled, you, myself,
at joy bliss -
as if i don't need want adore.
Her, it's that the torment
torture 'ould 'ave, well too much,
The worry to say. Translate it
as obsession, perhaps thralldom, 
chained to serving, her, well the idea
of her...looking at pictures
pondering, the last ones made me
uneasy, frantic...
concerned with perception, consequences.
my soul too quick to judge
my possessiveness too trigger happy
it's only in my mind, yet married
to imagination's novelty never antiquated.

in the dream aquarium. 
i am designing or redesigning cover art
i think she is saying something, 
perhaps again my wishful thinking
i went to sleep at ten...morning,
after the mourning  and the irony
of a criminal with the same name.
as someone in the family, venice
i turn over waking confronted beach
by who or what makes me play 'dirty laundry'...
it's three or so, rainy but not cool -
i assure you i'm not, loving her blind
of course there is a chance she hates me.
maybe there are two of her
one that needs me 
and one that makes my knees 
sneeze.  
bless you emilee both...
he grins at the line, all this sure-
yet what exactly can she do with all
this devotion or even love?  at least
her teacher gave her ten dollars -
once upon a time...besides if she 
was sitting here next to me would 
i still be into it. itself. maybe,
that bush is why said knowing humans
and fish can coexist in peace, did
her lifestyle imply mermaid. joy
to the world all the boys and girls,
take my advice or you'll curse the day
you started rollin' down that
lost highway...  'I want you to get 
a fuckin' driver's manual, 
and I want you to study 
that motherfucker!" 
	    
xv

s'ure there were lessons too.
i suppose i could, instruct
her on laziness - thoughts
crawl, red legged thru maze
outside of logic, yet
to make certain, these two
seemingly days i could spend more
time for her - carli i said fucking
of course i miss the point
down pull the details
who would risk. nickolodean jam master -
oh nobody looks at that sort of-
irony -yet the volusia watermark zone,
instead of knight or saint 
i dream sitcom. telling someone
i'm oldfashioned actually a pull over
top dress borderline slander

i need you to believe...in the impossible.
tailgate- you might ask what does he want
record, not much really- her salvation
in case the truth can indeed be twisted

"isis" "who do you love" "wide open" mojo...
medley med mera, tint my tangled hair
print my declaration again for her
which is starting to sound more 
unconditional than i want it to bee
honey  steak aunt buzz yet i'm still in a worry
dream a blur perhaps her- ancient architecture
yet awaking to mind foe as if
temple. skull, no sense church.
maggots trying to joint transaction. 
i can't stand the thought of being foolish-
the laughingstock of missed reflections
wanker won't miss pretty little liars
voting not to carry on further. they
'hould 'ave stopped too and let lucy shine.
lucifer lighters torch up religious smokes.
nothing is true everything is permitted -
shaving why do the blades suddenly all right.
the defintion of ride or die appears at arm.
no exit escape, what shape is this poetry
if it is not also prose. no exit escape, 
who is this man that needs her from head
to her toes...

he wants to edit that line -
who is this man in such need of her
from her head top down to her toes...

yes i feel like the last of the mohicans,
what are we eating emily, the blood
of our enemies. Magua will eat his heart...
Children under the knife...Seed wiped
out forever...
of course in a casual manner, protocol
you see...still, to give myself away
at unrequited love makes Dante nudge Virgil
'at least i actually looked at Beatrice once

any nairobian even thinking about nine year
old charlie horse won't make it - or i'll come back

it is, more accurate. unrequested love. 
what the hell might one reply -
rickles never really told a joke. 
In fact, mostly truths. i want to 
stick it to D & V, but my thoughts
are crowded with song lyrics,
not my own and lines from scipts
embedded like stars in the sky mind
but lookit, no i have not beheld
the object bitch of my adoration
yet you never got to see beatrice
post on social media, so it evens 
out.

i can't help it -

nothing to prove -
i animate counterrevolutionaries

begging i suppose you'd call it -
never let me goooooo...
nothing else doing nothing done
eyeliner, i'm shocked
worry all night
at her annoying altar. Still,
illogical yet
it must throw the opposition into chaos.

even as dreams flicker, i feel the
envy - you got something better,
you got a heart of stone... 
dream knife door invasion 
Rolled out wallet -
voodoo mojo on the floor

self reserved for her or
myself knowing the never us
like a dream playing basket

then the woman with circle heel.
wood, center nailed handing them to 
now confirmed, my confusion. 
how to high heel sneaker?
thoughts of her no doubt-
wake up to find you are the eyes,
of the girl, world spins 
notice i did not wish her here.
The, invitation was not to force,
indeed an option of freedom, well of
freedom chained to love's rioting addiction.

i can ony imagine eva died...
dreams of cousins, tweedle dee ...

a sort of clone copy since
we have no speak since i can't recall
they don't like dates, give it about
half a decade, literally not seen since
long ago xmas
somehow i manage to -

fantasy fuck, i suppose. 
but awake to lucy hale -
i don't know how to have imaginary friends, 
Emotions if I love Emilee
rain, love reign over me...
of course yes even if it happens...
i am going to say it is unrequired love.
go on pity the circus fool,
playing at damn this foil ain't

no invite to met gala
i order camphor

meanwhile pre-recorded men...

i wrote "homage" canto in minutes 
three versions, in the quick turns

yes i mean the knockers...thirty two delovely.
if they tell you i died and they were looking
through the place for evidence, ask what knife
stabbed through the door.  
(post-script, as i ate my turkey sandwich,
swallowing my pepsi in the lament of also
not having met john huston or mae west,
but happy to have not interacted with oj
i recalled that i wish wanted to 
actually start this prose-poem
with the line, i have not used
witchcraft to get a grant,
one of my mothers, who died
of loop us, gave me that mojo
i dreamt as being floored...
obviously, given that her and
keira admitted to hexan hexes,
it could be that i am under a spell -
or as mackenzie put placed it
can somebody tell this bitch 
nobody likes her...
in any case, i don't think that is 
the case. she had me ever since
you look like

in german means dream.
the trauma now eased -
molly the latest cut - 
how you feel is a national holiday -
tgi not hymn -
moonlight sonata- notes piano playing
the post i perhaps lament most -
not having is moonstone ring 
index finger, that divine hand... 
white stone if memory serves-
dream ejaculates pearls upon her hand...
yes i did give her a diamond
solitary man twice neil
i would kneel but for the 
unbending stars upon. knees,
presto agitato
it curves like a ferrari going ninety.

miles an hour down a dead end street
i get up, middle of the wee hours
clean - seven may turns eight,
a woman writes me... 
she's happy i don't want nudes 
question nuns at mall selling trinkets -
i tell her i desperately need
someome to speak with...
like food - 
but i am in love with ms grant, 
i can't believe my own inner ear -
bonehead committed to a an ethereal lesbian
pressing send i see she has three
humans sketched on her bicep
ferris wheel photograph
not much time  - later
haul with lauren lauren.
can you tell i'm not a hat person
now confirmed, by the sea lauren. 
i see wearing a three kitten tee...
she is or was at one time -
her favorite, way out within,
of the girls, 
notice i did not filter or prohibit.
The, idea is poetry,
indeed make it new, well of day
by day - tell of so i say.
but yes the diffidence that faltered...
like Spain, I'm bound to the past.
do you feel lucky, punk? 
sunk brazil by jings he done did it.

	   way out within;
	    
white mansions 
- waylon
jennings - 
	    
funny thang, when i wandered through
the run away from deletion,
as if on the lam from myself
(as these notes prove) 
i could not have foreseen
it would come to this,
embracing kiss through air
as only she could make it timeless.
the limo is waiting, sleep cadillac.
nap chevrolet. snooze volkswagon.
if she happens to tell you
oh him he even listens to the princess
and pauper soundtrack for me
he will have no
comment but maybe a howl. 
way out within.

So I'm walking down the street

 been looking for a salon, sweet lord
Ain't got two call
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home
Don't ease me in
 girl I love, she's sweet and true
You know that the dress she wears, sweet lord
It's pink and blue she brings me coffee
You know she brings me tea
She brings about every damn thing
I swear I'm gettin' her the jailhouse key...

(exile's letter,
-from pound's translation of li bai-
two skinny girls)
	    
Sokin of Rakuho, oh ancient friend, I now remember

you built me a special tavern,

By the south side of the bridge .

With yellow gold and white jewels

we paid for songs and laughter,

And we were stoned for month on month,

forgetting the kings and princes.

Intelligent men came drifting in, from the sea

and from the west border,

And with them, and with you especially,

there was nothing at cross-purpose;

And they made nothing of sea-crossing

or of mountain-crossing,

and only they could be of that fellowship.

And we all spoke out our hearts and minds …

and without regret.

And then I was sent off to South Wei,

smothered in laurel groves,

And you to the north of Raku-hoku,

Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories in common.

tween us. And when separation had come to its worst

We met, and travelled together into Sen-Go

Through all the thirty-six folds of the turning and twisting waters;

Into a valley of a thousand bright flowers …

that was the first valley,

then into ten thousand valleys

full of voices and pine-winds.

and With silver harness and reins of gold,


Out came the East-of-Kan boatswain and his company;

And there came also the “True-man” of Shi-yo to meet me,

Playing on a jewelled mouth-organ.

In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us

more Sennin music;

Many instruments, like the sound of young phœnix broods.

And the boatswain of Kan-Chu, intoxicated,

danced because his long sleeves

Wouldn’t keep still, with that music playing.

And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my head on his lap,

And my spirit so high that it was all over the heavens.

And before the end of the day we were scattered like stars or rain.

	    scattered like stars or rain...

I had to be off , far away over the waters,

You back to your river-bridge.

And your elder, who was brave as a leopard,

Was governor in Hei Shu and put down the barbarian rabble.

And one May he had you send for me, despite the long distance;

And what with broken wheels and so on, I won’t say it wasn’t going hard …

Over roads twisted like sheep’s guts.

And I was still going, late in the year,

in the cutting wind from the north,

And thinking how little you cared for the cost …

and you caring enough to pay it.

and what a reception!

Red jade cups, food well set, on a blue jewelled table;

 I was stoned, and had no thought of returning;

And you would walk out with me to the western corner of the castle,

To the dynastic temple, with the water about it clear as blue jade,

With boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and drums,

With ripples like dragon-scales going green grassy on the water,

Pleasure lasting, with courtezans going and coming without hindrance,

and the willow-flakes falling like snow,

And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset,

And the water a hundred feet deep reflecting green eyebrows—

Eyebrows painted green are a fine sight in young moonlight,

Gracefully painted—and the girls singing back at each other,

Dancing in transparent brocade,

And the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it,

Tossing it up under the clouds.

And all this comes to an end,

And is not again to be met with.

I went up to the court for examination,

Tried Layu’s luck, offered the khoyu song,

 got no promotion,

And went back to the East Mountains white-headed.

And once again we met, later, at the South Bridge head.

yes the crowd broke up—you went north to San palace.

And if you ask how I regret that parting?

It is like the flowers falling inspring’s end,

confused, whirled in a tangle.

What is the use of talking! And there is no end of talking—

There is no end of things in the heart.

I call in the boy,

Have him sit on his knees here to  seal this,

And  send it a thousand miles, thinking.

 The day sun, sun day
although "here" no dream
felt her drift away.
All white, cloud rain,
 skeleton drops in,
my first nickname
so you know, her love atop
pheobe tonkin, sapphic
Jump scare, to see her erotic,
I find a thousand knives
cassetted in chest rewinding...
playback of my desire, idk, wtf...
map of china slides off the wall
I continued in the mayhem
as if insane. settle down
into captions - why does it hurt
so despite the no chance -

knowledge, i do the dishes. 
mop dead sons, from why lament -
floor nocturne dawn, 
fuck them kids
modesty blaise no maybe
perhaps bell book and candle,
can't believe how good the steak...
takes the salt.
To say then in the remnants,
of madness yes but you don't
do much if you are thinking of her.
modus opera and i yeah but
that means i'm satisfied.
der holle rache
i ain't no holler back girl -
this shit is bananas
same meal five times he says.
no more, i roar...
cornered by nietzsche...
beyond good and evil
Not that you lied to me
	but that I no longer
believe you -
that is what has distressed me.
devil deal well she's the boss
girlboss, god zeal
i get up a little while ago
neverova in my thoughts putin.
mention  suze
as muse 
all those years ago;
goddess. hence soviet stamp
on handwroted lyric but
i'm terrible at balancing
paris blues
like sofia but catalan safe
for now, emilee please
let me obituary party...
no. sorry corman. 
no glot clom fly day...
of course the first second
i feel thinking of her
not much else does math,
love makes all else trivial.
soulless leftovers await.
no i am not trying to 
make sense, dear readers,
it's only a mind breathing
here an inhale there an exhale.
bound to fail, but a few
lines can't ever be tanned
by either sun as they 
remain pale...nearly untamed
at see through in the timeless
whenever there is ever.

	    lyric 1871 two skinny girls
from oliver's translation mostly)
	    
As I was floating down unconcerned Rivers
I no longer felt myself steered by the haulers:
Gaudy Redskins had taken them all for targets
Nailing them naked to coloured stakes.

I cared nothing for all my crews,
Carrying Flemish wheat or English cottons.
along with my haulers those uproars were done with
The Rivers let me sail downstream where I pleased.

Into the ferocious tide-rips
Last winter, more absorbed than the minds of children,
I ran! And the unmoored Peninsulas
Never endured more triumphant clamourings

The storm made bliss of my sea-borne awakenings.
Lighter than a cork, I danced on the waves
Which men call eternal rollers of victims,
For ten nights, without once missing the foolish eye of the harbor lights!

Sweeter than the flesh of sour apples to children,
The green waters penetrated my pinewood hull
washed me clean of the bluish wine-stains and the splashes of vomit,
Carrying away both rudder and anchor.

And from that time on I bathed in the Poem
Of the Sea, star-infused and churned into milk,
Devouring the green azures; where, entranced in pallid flotsam,
A dreaming drowned man sometimes goes down;

Where, suddenly dyeing the bluenesses, deliriums
the slow rhythms under the gleams of the daylight,
Stronger than alcohol, vaster than music
Ferment the bitter rednesses of love!

I have come to know the skies splitting with lightnings, and the waterspouts
And the breakers and the currents; I know the evening,
And Dawn rising up like a flock of doves,
And sometimes sometimes I have seen what men have imagined they saw!

I have seen the low-hanging sun speckled with mystic horrors.
Lighting up long violet coagulations,
Like the performers in very-antique dramas
Waves rolling back into the distances their shiverings of venetian blinds!

I have dreamed of the green night of the dazzled snows
The kiss rising slowly to the eyes of the seas,
The circulation of undreamed-of saps,
And the yellow-blue awakenings of singing phosphorus!

I have followed, for whole months on end, the swells
Battering the reefs like hysterical herds of cows,
Never dreaming that the luminous feet of the Marys
Could force back the muzzles of snorting Oceans!

I have struck, do you realize, incredible Floridas
Where mingle with flowers the eyes of panthers
In human skins! Rainbows stretched like bridles
Under the seas' horizon, to glaucous herds!

I have seen the enormous swamps seething, traps
Where a whole leviathan rots in the reeds!
Downfalls of waters in the midst of the calm
And distances cataracting down into abysses!

Glaciers, suns of silver, waves of pearl, skies of red-hot coals!
Hideous wrecks at the bottom of brown gulfs
Where the giant snakes devoured by vermin
Fell from the twisted trees with black odours!

I should have liked to show to children those dolphins
Of  blue wave, those golden, those singing fishes.
- Foam of flowers rocked my driftings
And at times ineffable winds would lend me wings.

Sometimes, a martyr weary of poles and zones,
The sea whose sobs sweetened my rollings
Lifted its shadow-flowers with their yellow sucking disks toward me
And I hung there like a kneeling woman...

Almost an island, tossing on my beaches the brawls
And droppings of pale-eyed, clamouring bird,
And I was scudding along when across my frayed cordage
Drowned men sank backwards into sleep!

But now now I, a boat lost under the hair of coves,
Hurled by the hurricane into the birdless ether,
I, whose wreck, dead-drunk and sodden with water,
neither Monitor nor Hanse ships would have fished up;

Free, smoking, risen from violet fogs,
I who bored through the wall of the reddening sky
Which bears a sweetmeat good poets find delicious,
Lichens of sunlight mixed with azure snot,

Who ran, speckled with lunula of electricity,
A crazy plank, with black sea-horses for escort,
When Julys would crush with cudgel blows
Skies of ultramarine into burning funnels;

I who trembled, to feel at fifty leagues' distance
The groans of Behemoth's rutting, and of the dense Maelstroms
Eternal spinner of blue immobilities
I long for Europe with it's aged old parapets!

I have seen archipelagos of stars! and islands
Whose delirious skies are open to sailors: 
- Do you sleep, are you exiled in those bottomless nights,
Million golden birds, O Life Force of the future? -

But, truly, I have wept too much! The Dawns are heartbreaking.
Every moon is atrocious and every sun bitter:
Sharp love has swollen me up with heady langours.
O let my keel split! O let me sink to the bottom!

If there is one water in Europe I want, it is the
Dark cold pool where into the scented twilight
A child squatting full of sadness, launches
A boat as fragile as a butterfly in May.

I can no more, bathe in your langours, O waves,
Sail in the wake of the carriers of cottons,
Nor undergo the pride of the flags and pennants,
Nor pull past the horrible eyes of the hulks.

ever is there when
ever timeless 
the in through see:
i feel so in love
so poetic yet i need
to i feel more prose
as certain things arose -
perhaps it is
her mentioning
crisis at midnight
a few days ago...or
that erotic vision...
my own business, mob
it is not mine or anyone's
affair - i simply debrief
myself as a writer writing...
i solely get emotional as
what they call now a pronoun
in lust-love 
yes, i hear judgements
and even hostility as if
i were a saint that 
could summon her 
or a slut stud
that could command her
neither nor either
her being 
at twentytwo 
older than my
recent adorations i
cannot expect to be
surprised by bullies
echoing guns and roses
as if unlocking the door
to some email laundry party...
no i don't know how to protect
her entirely and i get blinded
by jealousy irrational jealousy
in a manner of speaking...
obviously i ain't going
to plastic surgery tonkin myself
into pheobe...i went to sleep
in the late afternoon thinking
forever...got up at midnight.
dream of her in a vague
distance...it felt like
the bath, 
	imagining
there we are
but suddenly famine family
how can i ever explain
that i sense doing kitchen
work is murdering my unborn
offspring - when she started
at the salon she said she needed
the spring later i found 
a coiled metal in mattress
i am not sure how it should
arrive in thoughts so now
so me, we live in a post-modern
hookup friends with beans fit drug
divorce knife firearm destruction
so allow me to deconstruct it thus
i want her fidelity but it is mine
me saying yes to her is not her
agreement - the deal is 
just like that...although how
high i feel when it files mutual.
ohio calls but i wonder why omaha
mali-gnant burundi rimbaud in
the slavery business, i left in
the car horn
about 
	'Whose delirious skies are open to sailors...'
bc it was all in one take
& the stanza concludes with
	    'life force of the future'
then i felt as if arthur had
himself intended it like that -
i first translated that poem
for mother a long scotch tape scroll
given years ago...
that is to say we were acquainted...
i sat beauty portrait on my knee
and found her bitter...
i suppose some will gaze at
"we will fry your balls in olive oil"
and think it is melting as they near...
or maybe it was only knowing that
i was headed into this liner note
which again nearly missed telling
that usually it was li po in terms 
of exile's letter as it was peking
peek now li bai ahem beijing...
looking at it now i see her 
in the snow with a side smile
and twirl and only desire 
to make more explorations into
portraits of her...
apologies to all i have not
given proper attention to
in my obsession, i am under
a spell as you can tell
by how the words spill
	ever is there when
ever timeless 
the in through sea waves
and stories not salvation
still
drool saliva
ever is there when
ever timeless

lamia, oh lamia, It’s for your sake alone,
I’ve thirsted for blood, yeah i'm cold like a stone.
I’ve lived a thousand years, To weep and to mourn,
I am a vampire's child, where demon virgins moan .

hera took her offspring, their sunken eyes enslaved in clouds,
That made lamia a blizzard, That took me from the crowds:
i still feel the snow, cold white as a dog licked bone,
I am a vampire's child, where the angels have no throne.

I’ve built this floating castle , beyond jurisdiction,
Where I can see my lover, like a dream like an addiction:
Where I can hear the poets, recite from their gravestone,
I am a vampire's child, wed to bloodlust alone...

after breaking off the marriage...

the contradiction
at not liking porn
yet feeling an obligation
to know as it trends
gives me a sort of 
migraine of the soul...

i talk to senile mother
going off on a rant against
psycho logy, i suppose
i'm right but maybe
too explosive -

three in the morning now
sorrow mixed with confusion
even skirt is quiet...

guys look at the earrings i just made-
	    
cat likes to speak when
i slide out my sleep room -

the cannes fires up its engines...

but i'm hoping for the next polanski film.

emilee re-styled nails in blue and white

ribbons i thought were lace -

race through hours in some weird worry...

possibly knowing the impossibilty

of holding her hand, now when i need

it most. tilly i mean that figuratively.

	    man 

woman or teen
	    
	    how i 

hate that beatles song now...

as i type i feel the intrusion

either locals or so called next of kin

or most likely locals pretending it is kinning

oh rly...no i have not invited cleveland

	    'Tin soldiers and Nixon's comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio'...

	   xxxii
loaded lock, undone
by poem near done -
	to shut index
browser - he rewrites
nothing as good as first take
yet he has some of it in
iron butterfly

how sad. his sadness
in the movie...
witches and warlocks won't weep-
how can she mean so much
to his him
the latest informant claims

it stems from sixteen oh five
the same meal five x a day
maybe why he heard it in dream...

he only eats once a day
perhaps a snack
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
they say predestined ordained
sixty six
founding year of church of...
sat-
an
	    
twin flame soul mates
what a mess
meanwhile
is it leave me alone
to keep a stay
	    
not even she is able
to lower his rebel flag

James Innes Randolph Jr.
no tri
umph

leads to hours long no song
extended scrabble game
an a gram sniff nostril
guess air
	    
twirl hair-yes even fair is
foul has its places
	    
aces he should be
celebrating one of his
	new hit songs
instead of living in dark eyes -
	How I love you, how I fear you,
It seems I met you in an unlucky hour!
	no not 1874
the empire burlesque
	    I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes
	    
he sleeps he naps he snaps at visions
...he finds faith yet tells her
the kerouac mind is too vast 
now translated as tv mind
	like a commercial interruption
reserved for emilee
still he appreciates the hallucination

	thinking however
	what if the spirit world
	is like freshman universe
	fake idea at fashion bar

he can feel her there with him

but the motley crew cuts in like static -

makes him smoke more than he indent intend
in the end yeah he simply can't 

figure if this extemporanous second
draft is near enough to 

going across the ocean with grandfather edwin
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
Can touch him further.

we mow down one of the lesser prime ministers
with rap rounds
	    fee echo wrap


nothing but proverbial net

spa soap face

rylee extremely sexy for a wednesday.
alexandra locked out climbs spandex into window.
but he's thinking why would

a grown woman tell 
	    
	   an "ethnic"

gru op to kick the fucking door dow...n.

harpers reports americans were more content 
	in 2020
he wonders if any of his fell owl merickins
realize how many repeat episodes of 
the sitcom presidency they have been
put placed through true story so sorry

his mind a jigsaw puddle puzzle
near tears anytime there is a tear
in the logic of her yet 
his thoughts jet plunder peace
at her imagined presence

precisely then he thought; also -
as if he didn't have enough aint it thoughts
paint it painted lit
- that railroad dream right there with her
as she disappeared was only saying
from the scot lariat
	bring the rope
The only way you'll hang is by the neck
Nigga, bolt off the set-
the only word he frowns upon now is bet,
used to be bovine...
	    in a moo calf sense
leather wip how was that for us
ah to be safely thus...
	    excuse him he's an 
excitable boy they can always half
argue over the werewolf and the pants
	over the moon
	is it too soon
	does he ultimatum 
	only to cower at her tower
	tips are welcome
	i come grimalkin
not to mention the unmentionable
emotion of losing an aunt and mother
as if a coordinated double tap
irony spat upon face it
slowly
Nobody wants to do the crazy things we used to do before
	this took an hour 
	wilted is the flower
        oh how i wanted it to be 
	    those original petals...
manuscripts don't burn
he won't real true grit know until
reading it back at some other our...
what the hell it's the lyric to bat
	outta hell -
And no one's gonna stop me now, I'm gonna make my escape
But I can't stop thinking of you
And I never see the sudden curve 'til it's way too late
which he always heard or sang along to 
instead 
	    side arm curve
arm side is her name indeed can't stop
a stupid man in a suit of smoke.
he recalls his own line, floor of ashes
but he is not certain how to steal from himself -
at the very let there be light here
it was 'a person in love is stealing,
what else keeps the image' from one of 
his later poems - lay teaser pose
a promise is a promise
we believe his sorrow aside from the obvious
is rooted in the fact that his deal is far from
fair. fair from far, far away and over the hills
thrills that await further thrills still.


	    post-script
spasibo bulgakov, what actually 
went down was yet in the secondary
set of pages yeah here is how
it was meant to go:))
	    
	gee or jee, he was awful
sad out of my mind -
in the film
witches and warlocks
don't weep
he sleeps he eats he naps

he wonders how.
does she rly mean so much...
the last informant
claims it was preordained
a twin flame soul mate


he thinks 
(I have thee not, and yet I see thee still)
sixteen oh five maybe that	    
	    is why he heard
the dream say same meal five times a day...

sixty six he eats once perhaps a snack
founding date of the church
of sat-
an

he's lost in an extended scrabble 
an a gram of sniff nostril
guess air heart of glass...

did he eat of the insane root
going off on leave me alone then
don't leave me alone-
tri umph, but she must know
not even she is able to 
lower his rebel flag-


James Innes Randolph Jr
he is right about not 

knowing if spiritually-
	    
fake ids are a thing
like freshman universe pub-

dang kerouac's vast mind...

turned into tv mind.

tea vision faith

i caint cheat he says to her -

reserved for emilee...

revising the expanding jigsaw
puddle puzzle

splish splash he was 

supposed to be celebrating

	    one
of his hit songs...

instead dark eyes
	    
	    How I love you, how I fear you,
It seems I met you in an unlucky hour!

no not 1874 the empire burlesque

But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized

All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes...

he listens again with grandfather edwin

Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
Can touch him further.

i see now the railroad dream was not maybe
my insecurity a scot lariat 
 bring the rope...

(it was thursday which
felt like a sunday

in contrast
a dozen soviet leaders
in the same time frame...

i dunno why i went
third person into pluralities

so to subtract the vices
there has been more
diversity in moscow
than new york) or washington...

that is where i remember
emilee in the snow -

love that vibe face grin
listening to pupil in
oak chair pose

i can't escape it

even viewing late night with the devil

(film gets a few things very correctly right)

i try to save her by playing my ten scales

later greeted by her in the silky azure top

she looks thin and not carefree

i say to myself it's the blouse from

you have nothing to be ashamed of 

yet it is also the costume from these are 

my sisters crumblin'

reading the words back, i'm overwhelmed

by how clearly meatloaf rises in ear memory

possibly for once upon a time

i don't want no pickle i just wannna ride

on my motorcycle looking at sky instead of road

crashed into a ditch...

i figured, since it is dressy, she is going out.

i shave, slip into sleep -

a strange sensation that her aunt betrayed her...

i dream in another language woman with boy

there implying to the kid be nice to her...

obvious invasion of body snatcher

day before also a scene in that speaking

pretty woman something about shopping -

baffled, puzzlin' evidence...mystery achievement -

i turn in bed i return to bleeding soul in scene

fulfilled it is her, well pictures of her

yet luminous, lovely just like i imagine...

for a minute i am extremely satisfied.

ride dream into subway train, estimating

the walk from wall street to times square

circle no question, no direction home -

ludivine then in her house, i guess she

heard me thinking of swimming pool 

paranoia is keira trying to kill me 

outta envy -

even the wristwatches seem vague

gerard is packing gifts, i don't know

don't have as good a french memory as hollywood

but yeah in that two part masterpiece

they were sort of co-stars -

zodiac devilish emilee recall...

post with gothic chanting, enchanting -

anyway i awake to wear the worry

that perhaps all this thinking of

her is too much, 

yet in the untangible me

i know it is only the way i am

maybe even the way she wants me.

if she would. 

 xxxiv
(eight saturday teen
felt like a frying says

table sayeth dream
a technicolor cinemath
i couldn't count...

division mind breathing
the cut down birnam forest

so to dunsinane thinking
not stopping
till they all smash
heart shaped eye emo gee) 

is it a quiz
life questions don't quit-

when life gives you lemons
the file of thelma
no reel asian to thelema

to thine own do what thy will

till furniture porn field

(six tee yards d/same bird)

i haitian python-anywhere

pray to saint anne

heche 

jet lag, the dead travel fast

no even faster than that 

i'm in volusia, i'm in manhattan

i'm in cannes half blind from 

the bills of flash photography

i'm here and in moscow

not to mention london

it is not heresy and i will not recant

can't confirm rejuvenatin' pope

with the flesh of pervert priests

chopped up in rome basement so

six stops lesson you count seven

dorothy ozzy kansas

gall bladderless sibling

pictures me with the president

of the south american nick cage

fan club - dearly departing aunt

to be precise but it irks me

lika tattoo in reverse

leica it werent a gift feeling

but a graft thieving

i even confuse emilee with emily

stones undercover of the night

we got nothing to prove

it's pretty lib ear aint it

liberating, funny i feel

no freedom, hounded -

can't have me no woman 

don't want me no man

i'm happy emilee had a nice brekkie

leads one to askkk

why keep me from my own her mind

imagine imagination barbwire girl

in a barbwire world

driver and car all up in flames

suddenly some other alice

emails i axe plain i'm taken

dylan asked if you can read 

my mind why must i speak

silence is what ate tits

i only have eyes for tits,

i mean you.

yeah i could or should

quotation mark or punctuate

yet i fear drowning in form

as i swim - nevertheless

spam quote "keira sent

you a booty call"

peach emoji tween y and c

whine and sea

the argument goes i got you those gloves

reminds me of dead ringers, hi rachel
	    
smh, i question if i am coming off

as trivial - 

my stance is serious 

cyrus the climb at this point

in the journey i suppose something

is detached the house itself

not being shakespeare or at the globe

i don't much enjoy repeating 

but i sense i have to sneeze it again

bless you all but in the present

i'm only pondering emilee grant

goodness gracious great balls of fire penis

i hate all men

'So there I was sitting in front of Jed's
store over in Cunt Lick
my peter standing up 
straight as a jack pine
under my Levis 
just a-pulsin' in the sun ...'

restore myself to barbie as princess and pauper

i won't admit listening to

man woman or teen i can feel that heat closing in

put the groceries away

rice onions 

skirt overdosing on the chicken

barbara stanwyck fading out

streisand i didn't mention

but now that dream wherein i saw her

egh not bs standing by the fridge

dirt on one of her shoulders

a stranger reaching a touch

me picking up chair to strike him away

awaking to a baffled morning

i didn't wroted since the idea seemed

local not locatable

yet now it seems to be locked in with

what i have felt as repercussions

"Seems," madam? Nay, it is; I know not "seems."

is the rest silence? bra speaks tits

there's a nipple to this curve

but you will nibble it out of

context everywhich way but cut

from the fact the innocent

fact that i love all her faces,

and this traces that oath -

races away from both

night and day, into beyond.

ya ever burn a nigger?

and strolling minstrels play

but i'd rather be in my library

reading science books all day

lilly lets out mr wiggles

as if to harmonize

mr wiggens is obituarized

yes, emilee, i nearly did party

but i promise it wasn't no ball

darn imaginary promises

poses the memory mid sentence

like boo hoo rating the act

mostly in mids i believe

the only time filmed walking

out to lunch from lucky cat

gas station guy if you recall

i suspect that hubris led to 

missing bath and bail

baph O! met i hope 

the state of flow rid

expunges before my

cosmas and damian coughs

didn't you know it

she's with stupid

lamb's lahar here ink

on his arm

'the crazy will of margaret
	thatcher that they've all got'

french drawing soraya
stuck on new testament
book of revelations
tune turning it into collage

(in case i missed any mayhem;
you don't want to sell me death sticks
you want to go home and rethink your life)
what the fuck is star wars about

dear vulkan


it is the twentieth of may - as i sit here, head melting,
after sex melting, surrounded by smoke 
and thoughts of my beloved emilee

at the end of the book - ah yes hail before you look,
through the clock's delay at my promised song
know that i gave your wife two covers

and while hopefully painting mine, caravaggio
said it was whispered to him even before 
macbeth of real witch bard

so perhaps mutual, look at the boy bit by lizard -
then two baby reptilians on my floor slide
lavatory as if replacing Kleenex ants

therefore not elvis but you are the fountain
source father in a sense constant
avalanche further

savage in ibu indonesian crimson
purple photograph insane press
rivals gerhardt richter

center for volcanology and geological
hazard mitigation handout words
nobody uses


yet enough prelude let me poem
magical deity underworld
plumed red;

	    

the skies'
little clouds 
are made 

mere bridges upon your
landslide 
said
	    
molten with
ash ash ash so nothing
flies, nothing lies

fire ropes spew as if lords
themselves /i here humble
mumble to have 
	    
your minute
a few 
seconds 
	
more in destruction praise

a mayakovsky cat
purring no copy at your altar
unfurled every any place soared 
	
where my promised verses myth
beatnik fee line howl 
port of saints

forgiveness i beg distracted by her
lava tail

and "abigail" stealing my 
stack of rotting corpses

scream gang hammered scam
patterns sterling i watch them force
a man to retire

yet as your child planted like a mountain
upon eras beyond epoch
i do not rumble

dollars of death will come when they will
and then if you are native we shall kill!
yet remaining pure

a hundred years from now
or a thousand
to glance back 
	    
at the prodco dinosaur
that dared bring it on 
four a mere million
arriflex

illion the hex till none flex

there then now 
as for the welded girl
this fire implores
	    
you to make her trillion
see we were wroted before 

genesis
and after revelations
	    
in the book here
i say it is her, since infancy 
yet i learn it (as also myself 
in spirt womb'ed)

debris umbilical chords 
i couldn't music
for my days and nights 
were dedicated
to love's addiction

into the mystic into rivers into seas
where they even try to drown your 
highness with vlc players

ha! the UN itself a power walk
to stop your talk
bustle hawk

oh! i did say few seconds only 
a  minute...
	    
brevity soul wit
	    
bewitched by virgin foam of living
wagering on death

sometimes i feel the world
is blind to me
	    
but i am only bound 
to you and love
	    
so take my leaving word

and hail once more...
as i learned
from wagner 
	    
himself-healing only a drum's beat-light 
raised pretty high into every any place 
sword where valkyrie eternal.
